# Public Administration: Pre-Written Examples {#pa-pre}

This chapter is constructed around PA themed questions. The questions you encounter will by nature not be exactly the same as these, or other previous comprehensive exams, even within your own program. There is always at least a little variability. Therefore, I suggest students construct a variety of written answers that are built around *themes*. These themes are common to the study of public adminsitration, and generally will hold across academic contexts.

Once you're caught up here, you may want to check out the examples of real-world comprehensive exams [found in a later chapter](#pa-real).

## Bureaucracy

### Example Questions

#### Bureaucratic Responsiveness

>While the courts are often described as reactive, other institutions, such as Congress and the bureaucracy are assumed to be more proactive.  Given the large and constantly growing literature on agenda-setting in the policy process as well as the various frameworks explaining interest group activity and Congressional action, how true is it that the bureaucracy in particular can be seen as truly proactive?  Do bureaucrats shape their policy domains or do they primarily attempt to balance and accommodate outside pressures?

#### Bureaucracy, Administrative State

>Scholars of American politics often neglect the single largest element in U.S. government, the bureaucracy, leaving it to scholars of public administration as if less important.  However, there have been some Americanists who have taken an active interest in explaining how the need to control and even motivate the enormous federal bureaucracy has shaped such constitutional branches as Congress and the Presidency.  Explain how the development of large and complex federal bureaucracy in the post-World War II (and perhaps especially post Great Society) era has led to new understandings of Congress and the Presidency.  How has the regulatory welfare state changed the nature of political leadership, the different roles of legislators and chief executives, and the relationship between the constitutional branches?

#### Bureaucratic Autonomy

>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Trump Administration has already prompted great attention to the scope of bureaucratic autonomy and discretion in policy making and implementation.  What does the scholarly literature tell us about the nature, sources, and degree of bureaucratic autonomy in the policy process?  Will this be an Achilles heel for the Trump Administration or a source of strength?

### Potential Bureaucracy Short Answers and Prompts

#### Principal Agent Theory

Principal-agency theory holds that democratic hierarchies shape the output of public bureaucracies. 

#### Street Level Bureaucracy, Wicked Problems, Police

The American public’s view of the police officer is deeply mediated through the images presented to it via two competing visions: that of the iconic Hollywood policeman, tough, heroic, unfeeling, and hardened to the street; and that of the news media, in which it is shown a clouded, violent man visiting unlawful violence upon vulnerable communities.  The American police officer is at once the most iconic of public servants, haloed in film, and yet in the modern moment also the clearest symbol associated with a public grown discomfited with the violence of authority. Lost in these two inimical views is the human who inhabits the uniform.

A paradoxical tension between myth and reality is stubbornly American. “We are able to believe that our government is weak, stupid, overbearing, dishonest, and inefficient, and at that same time we are deeply convinced that it is the best government in the world, and we would like to impose it upon everyone else,” writes John Steinbeck (Steinbeck, 2003, p. 330), “We speak of the American Way of Life as though it involved the ground rules for the governance of heaven.” Nowhere is the paradox of American thought about their government and its administration more evident than in policing. Raised on Andy Griffith only to be horrified by Rodney King’s abuse; taught the hazards of drug use by Officer Friendly in elementary school only to be shocked by the brutality of officers captured on cell phone video. Who could blame a skeptical public for fractured views on police?

The public, largely educated on policing ‘reality’ via Hollywood and the crisis-of-the-day coverage promulgated by a news cycle obsessed media, is starved for information about the people inside the uniform, and the impossible work they confront every day. The public is asked to embrace a hero-worship of our first responders, a worship shaped so successfully by film and television. Yet when that worship is confounded by the same instruments which built it, this paradoxical, rigid view shakes along fault lines of profession, race, class, and location. Public administration gathers information among the fields of each, processing the information through theory, and producing solutions of its own. 

In avoiding sole reliance on either dogma or experiment, public administration enables a transition to a more humanistic understanding of the front-line law enforcer; we blunt the sharpest edges of the paradox. A realistic, humanistic view allows a moderation of both the exaggeratedly heroic view of police work, as well as the crippling disappointment when the nightly news once again reminds us of the awful acts a human is capable of, even one in uniform. That is not to say that the institution of policing is not responsible for failure. As noted in other works (Epp, Maynard-Moody, & Haider-Markel, 2014; Maynard-Moody & Musheno, 2012a), the impacts of officer discretion are nuanced. While individual officer behavior is better explained by agency policy and legalistic guidance than by individual attitude and bias, the policies themselves can perpetuate inequity, and the juridical bounds may grant so much latitude that they “take on the nature of a farce” (Maynard-Moody & Musheno, 2012a, p. S18).

The tension inherent in the American view of the police officer is a long-standing, complex, and wide-ranging problem, qualifying it easily within the ranks of the ‘wicked problems’ (Rittel & Webber, 1973) for which public administration is best situated to address. A social science isolated from the problems it purports to study has hobbled itself unnecessarily; public administration, uncomfortable from birth with rigid academic boundaries, finds its most sure footing in addressing the big, wicked problems: “The field of public administration, broadly defined, confronts the wicked problems of society” (Shields, 2008, p. 212). Through its embrace of practical solutions unbound by rigid definitions of academic taxonomy, public administration is best suited to address complex public problems through its tradition of pracademics, a “practice which has been a fundamental aspiration of public administration since its founding” (Posner, 2009, p. 12).

The marriage of academic and practitioner worldviews to address the “wicked problems” is not without precedent. In fact, there is a strong argument that the founding of our academic tradition used the same coupling to address the pressing public administration issues of that time in a similar way. As noted by Patricia Shields (2008), grounding reformers’ aspirations in the reality of the people working on the frontlines was a common goal of both Jane Addams and John Dewey, a reflection of theories of street-level bureaucrats sixty years later (Lipsky, 1983). These contemporary Progressives pushed back on a reformation whose inquiry was unguided by the input of those most affected by both the crisis and solution. Addams was suspicious of ideas uninformed by the underlying humanity of those involved, and in her view of democracy, we must (Addams, 2002, p. 51) “…take pains to keep common ground in our human experiences.” Inspired by Jane Addams, John Dewey echoes the sentiment (Dewey & Rogers, 2012, p. 20): “The man who wears the shoe knows best that it pinches and where it pinches, even if the expert shoemaker is the best judge of how the trouble is to be remedied.”  

#### Frederickson, Social Equity

During the same general period as Lipsky was publishing his report, H. George Frederickson (1971) was calling for scholars to adopt “social equity” as a basic value of public administration. Frederickson e argues that social inequity “constitutes a fundamental, if long-range, threat to the viability of this or any political system” and  concludes, “[I]t appears that new Public Administration is an alignment with good, or possibly God.”

One possible synthesis of Lipsky and Frederickson is seeing the discretionary powers of street-level bureaucrats as increasing social equity. After all, as Lipsky (1983) writes, “The poorer people are, the greater the influence street-level bureaucrats tend to have over them.” 

Yet that imagined synthesis of Lipsky and Frederickson does not appear to have convinced modern scholars, who see line-officer discretion as hard to control and even a root cause of social inequity. For example, Caldero and Crank (2018) see police departments as “upside-down bureaucracies” where police managers have little or no control over line officers and their discretionary decisions. Because street level bureaucrats are tasked with impactful discretionary decisions with little direct supervision, they are invisible to managers and thus difficult to correct. 

Maynard-Moody and Musheno (2012b) are especially leery of police officers discretion, arguing it is within this discretionary power that social inequity is allowed to propagate: “Racial disparities, then, occur in investigatory stops in which law enforcement personnel are granted substantial legal autonomy and are least subject to administrative oversight.” 

#### Principal-Agent Problems, Principled Agent? Dilulio (1994)

Two competing views of discretion in BWC activation emerge. In the first, situated within the principal-agent problem literature (Miller, 2005), officers are likely to choose to activate a BWC according to their desires and attitudes rather than acting as required by their ‘principals,’ the agency and the community. The principal-agent problem, then, arises when public employees act “not as public-spirited souls but as self-seeking slugs who are disposed to shirk, subvert, and steal whenever and wherever they can get away with it” (Dilulio Jr, 1994, p. 278). At the extreme of this view, officers will subvert the intended benefit of BWCs through their control of the cameras’ activation, specifically (Kerrison, Cobbina, & Bender, 2018, p. 281) “their ability to turn [the BWC] off or position a partner to block the view finder frame.” Even in the absence of motivation to hide outright criminal behavior, in the principal-agent problem view, officers with cynical attitudes towards BWCs because of perceptions that camera footage will be used against them, or negatively impact their professional practices and discretion (Katz, Choate, Ready, & Nuño, 2014) may opt to activate the cameras less, as (Newell & Greidanus, 2018, p. 4) “officer perceptions and interpretations of the technology may impact how they use it.”

The second view of discretion in the BWC context can be situated with the ‘Principled Agent’ theory advanced by John D. Dilulio (1994). Dilulio argued that principal-agent theory is useful in explaining the relatively rare instances where public employees chase their self-interest, subverting their principals' wishes and guidance. What principal-agent theory lacks, argues Dilulio (p. 277), is sufficient explanatory power to help us understand what motivates public employees to “perform thankless tasks, go above and beyond the call of duty, and make virtual gifts of their labor even when the rewards for behaving that way are highly uncertain at best.” Following Dilulio’s work (1994), research has consistently found weak or non-existent links between officer attitudes and behavioral outcomes. Arrest decisions are not predicted by job satisfaction (Smith & Klein, 1983), nor DUI arrests by attitudes about enforcement (Mastrofski, Ritti, & Snipes, 1994; Meyers, Heeren, & Hingson, 1989).  Officer attitudes towards domestic violence are not strongly linked to domestic violence arrests (Stith, 1990), and officer attitude fails to predict coercive behavior by officers (Terrill & Mastrofski, 2002). Engel and Worden (2003) directly investigate the link between officer attitude and behavior and find no link, concluding that agency policy and supervision is predictive of officers’ problem-solving. 

#### Early PA writers

The most recognized early writings on the role of bureaucracy in American politics come from Woodrow Wilson (Wilson, 1887), who would later go on to attain the presidency. Wilson held that politics and administration are, and should be, completely separate spheres of governing. This view prevailed for several decades in American political thought. This view flowed easily from the Madisonian view of American political structure (Madison, 1787) that was preoccupied with avoiding the evils of factions. Madison and other pluralistic writers hoped to balance the wheel of democracy by incentivizing electoral competition among competing interest groups. Wilson’s (1887) initial conception of the politics-administration dichotomy was later enhanced by Frank Goodnow (2017), who sought harmony between the expression of the will of the state (politics) and execution of the same (administration). Goodnow believed  that political control of the administrative functions was important, and pointed to constitutional separation of powers as driving conflicts between the two. Goodnow further believed that political parties therefore filled the void, spending time lobbying for their own administrators.

The dangers of too much political control of the bureaucracy became clear in the wake of the Watergate era. In Mosher’s (1974) view Watergate was an aberration, and extension, and a culmination of events that had their root in a lack of bureaucratic independence. The overwhelming drive to re-elect Nixon subsumed all other ethical and legal considerations for many in the administrative agencies. There was a "purge" of top-level officials following Nixon’s first term, where anyone deemed too hesitant or lacking pure loyalty was removed. The Watergate climate was a result of too close a relationship between the political and administrative sphere’s, with the political side pressuring the administrative side to take action designed solely to enlarge presidential power. 

#### Frederick Taylor and “Scientific Management”

Taylor argued for better management decisions through the development of “laws, rules, and even to mathematical formulae.” He ends the selected article with an example of managing a baseball team, and states: “Every single element of the game of baseball has been the subject of the most intimate, the closest study of many men…” A modern way of reading Taylor’s approach is to assume a statistical approach to public management. Taylor’s approach to management, particularly his desire to produce a “larger output per man...as well as an output of better and higher quality,” was a science of the laboring body. 

The embrace of Taylorism was intextribly linked to an abstraction of the laborer, a view that has been called the “productivism” of early late 19th and early 20th century management (Rabinbach, 1992). Productivism was a view of human labor as (Scott, 1999, p. 98) “a mechanical system which could be decomposed into energy transfers, motion, and the physics of work.” In America, Taylor is responsible for establishing the technocratic framework in which to measure and administer that mechanical system (Maier, 1970). Taylorism was not a political system, or even a democratic one, but instead played to the high modernist, utopian visions (Scott, 1999) in America and beyond (Rabinbach, 1992, p. 272): 

>“Taylorism and technocracy were the watchwords of a three-pronged idealism: the elimination of economic and social crisis, the expansion of productivity through science, and the reenchantment of technology. The vision of society in which social conflict was eliminated in favor of technological and scientific imperatives could embrace liberal, socialist, authoritarian, and even communist and fascist solutions. Productivism, in short, was politically promiscuous.”

The promise of technological solutions was attractive to Progressives as they sought to alleviate class struggle and suffering. The classical public administration born in the pragmatic and Progressive early 20th century was one that embraced scientism. This embrace had the unintended effect of silencing the important voices of women who ran the settlement houses of the period. Science was understood to be a masculine pursuit, while the human centered approaches of the “settlement women” were left behind by Progressive men who tired of being slandered as “long haired men” in emasculated service of “short haired women” (Stivers, 2002).

#### The Modern Taylorism

Taylorism did not disappear when “classic” public administration was replaced by behavioral, and then modern, conceptions of public administration. The Enlightenment endowed us with a modern tendency to prescribe transparency for all that ails our governing and government. A “Panoptic Taylorism” (Adams & Mastracci, 2019) can be seen in modern policy making, for example, in placing body-worn cameras on police officers. ‘Panoptic’ refers to the additional Foucauldian gaze (Foucault, 1977; Vickers, Birch, Galovic, & Kennedy, 2016) of the “public, policy makers, media, courts, and agency administration – upon officers, who are constantly aware of the possibility of being watched, even if no one ever actually watches the recording” (p. 401). One can also detect the influence of Taylor in the policies that seek ever more control of when officers activate their cameras (Lawrence, McClure, Malm, Lynch, & La Vigne, 2019). These policies are born in the “(unlikely) hope of imposing perfect order and outcomes on what is at its taproot a profession imbued with chaos” (Adams & Mastracci, 2019, p. 401). 

#### Representative Bureaucracy

The politics-administration dichotomy is sometimes seen as a quaint or naïve view of the shape of bureaucracy by scholars, but the normative value of a neutral bureaucrat still has a powerful hold on American’s view of the bureaucracy.

#### Big Data & Bureaucracy

Surveillance is a social process that invokes power (Foucault, 1977) that has to be understood through more than the ‘decisionist’  or ‘technocratic’  lenses (Comte, 1855; Habermas, 1970; Simon, 1972).  Habermas (1970) distinguishes between what he deems the decisionist, pragmatist, and technocratic theories of expertise, arguing against the rational choice (decisionist) and technocratic conceptions of bureaucratic and political problem solving that reduces problems to the merely technical (Simon, 1972). Instead, he argues, we ought to adopt the early pragmatism of John Dewey and see problem solving as an ongoing conversation (Dewey & Rogers, 2012). 

#### Big Data, Policing, Public Admin, Ethics, Marx

Between 2012 and 2018, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu contracted with big data analytics firm Palantir, using the company’s predictive policing technology to address the city’s murder rate, which was sixth highest in the nation.  The partnership between city government and private sector big data provides fertile ground for the public policy questions swirling around the big data, algorithmic bias, and the future of public service work. On the one hand, the partnership was born and lived in secrecy, and the powers of surveillance it granted were out of balance with what is commonly expected for local government. As one critic summed up, "It’s almost as if New Orleans were contracting its own version of the NSA to conduct 24/7 surveillance of the lives of its people,” (Winston, 2018). 

By other measures, the program was successful in its aim. New Orleans used Palantir’s data and methods to identify the top 1% of “violent crime drivers”  (Ferguson, 2017, p. 34) as well as those most likely to be the victims of homicide. The murder rate in New Orleans fell by nearly 22%, while gang-related murders fell by 55%, all in a relatively short span between 2011 and 2014. The comparative murder rates during the same period fell nationally by 4%, while the rate for the regional South was unchanged (FBI, 2012, 2015). 

Big data is new technology, but some of the questions it poses for public administration are old – how do we craft public policy which is effective, efficient, and equitable? Simple questions do not suggest simple answers, however. The big data in question is held privately but proxied through governmental use, research in this area is notably difficult. In Ferguson's typology of big data , this is a form of ‘black data,” so named because it is opaque, has disproportionate effects on communities of color, and is the latest in-fashion technology. The data and algorithms used by companies such as Palantir hide behind patents and other commercial protections, and despite having a tremendous impact on public policy are not easily forced into the public (and scholarly) view through traditional means such as the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

Framing the New Orleans example with public ethics values in mind, the rapid and significant reduction of homicides is undoubtedly effective, but there are reasons to suspect the big data solution was also an equitable one. Homicides in New Orleans disproportionately victimized black men. Analysis of the sharp drop in homicides between 2012 and 2015 (Asher, 2016) shows that “Murder was down citywide almost exclusively because of drops in murder among African Americans.” How should public administration scholars weigh the policy implications of thirty-two fewer black men killed in 2015 compared to 2012 against the disproportionate impact of big data policing on those who reside in a community targeted for high risk offenders and victims?

Big data influences how, who, and where we police (Ferguson, 2017). The policy questions posed by the rapid rise of big data across public agencies, including police agencies, have been slow to gather the scholarly attention needed to shape the policy answers effectively. The expanding gap between the use of technology and public administration values (Battaglio & Hall, 2018, p. 826) poses risks to “privacy and performance as decisions are increasingly autonomous, and as technological advances outpace government’s ability to regulate them.”

Gary Marx (Marx, 1998) is admirable for his far-seeing scholarship focused on structuring ethical approaches to surveillance, and his work is well-suited to help public administration scholars address the questions posed by government’s use of big data. While Marx’ twenty-nine questions to interrogate the ethics of surveillance are too long to replicate here, his insistence on respecting the dignity of the individual, and focusing on the means, context, and conditions of data collection is a useful place to begin policy debates about government and big data. A theme throughout Marx’ writing on surveillance (Marx, 1998, 2003, 2016) is that surveillance is neither good nor bad. The World Health Organization’s (WHO) massive surveillance programs are qualitatively different than similarly scaled efforts by national security organizations prying into the communications of citizens. Before we can draw substantive conclusions about a particular surveillance regime, we should understand and articulate the setting, means, and goals of the surveillance. 

The risk that algorithms will amplify the implicit biases of their human programmers is real, but so is the possibility of reduced explicit biases. New Orleans big data choices have been rightfully and widely critiqued for the decision to hide the program from public sight – but a 20% reduction in overall homicides and a 55% reduction in gang-related homicides, if replicable, is a tempting outcome for mayors across the country grappling with violent crime. The privacy critiques leveled by Ferguson and others concerned about the disproportionate effects of increased police surveillance on communities of color are no less salient in public policy debates, but with the New Orleans program titled “NOLA For Life,” the focus of practitioners on saving lives must be acknowledged. Big data policing poses risks, but given the history of disproportionate effects of traditional policing on communities of color, it begs the question: Compared to what?

#### Ethics Triad – Bowman & West

Three ethical approaches for public administration have been described as the ethics triad (Bowman, West, & Beck, 2014). The ethics triad uses a results-based approach, a rule-based approach, and a virtue-based approach. Using a results-based approach is generally a utilitarian approach, and seeks the greatest good for the greatest number. The rules based approach is based in applying legal principles, court rulings, constitutional law, and regulations to an issue. The ethics triad is the virtue-based approach, which centers around one’s own character, and “nurtures individual and collective well-being” (Bowman & West, p. 119). Each of the three approaches can be used independently, but using all three “is especially helpful in examining ethical issues wherein there is no clear sense of right and wrong” (Bowman et al., 2014, p. 119).

#### Bureaucratic Ethics? O’Leary – Could be its own thing with a bit more, or a good closing to an ethics essay?

It is tempting to imagine a government bureaucracy in which all decisions are just ones, the policies equitable ones, and the outcomes simply a matter of fiat. Unfortunately, such a paradise does not exist. Our government is, crucially, of the people. And by virtue of being populated by the people, in all their flaws, our government is necessarily going to make flawed decisions, implement flawed policies, and have outcomes which range between problematic and disastrous. In this reality, the expectation that all public servants must always follow all orders is dangerous, and conflicts with the very ideals of our American experience. The response here will proceed first in answering the implicit ethic found commonly in pseudo-militaristic organizations, but prevalent across government agencies (O’Leary, 2013): public servants should obey the orders they are given, and that political control of the administrative agencies is essential (Goodnow, 2017). Second, the value of dissent within government will be examined (O’Leary, 2010).

#### To Obey or Not Obey

The critic’s preference for unthinking obedience intends to normalize an idealized militaristic ethic into a context it does not belong. The critic’s base assumption here is that unfailing obedience is endemic to militaristic organizations, presumably informed by notions of military obedience. However, not only is the context wrong, the idea that the military is full of robotic ‘yes sirs’ is to misunderstand the military and organizations organized along pseudo-militaristic lines (Caldero et al., 2018; Cowper, 2000). Perhaps the most famous American general of the 20th century, George S. Patten, famously said, “If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.” The military thrives on the creativity of its members at every rank. In combat, under fire, facing imminent death – perhaps this is the time for unthinking response to orders. Yet even then, the military recognizes there are higher oaths and responsibilities every soldier has which supersede the need to follow orders. The Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ, 1956), while making it clear that a service member must follow all legal orders (Articles 90 and 92), also is equally clear that service members have a duty to not follow obviously illegal orders (Reeves & Wallace, 2016): 

>“Still, the UCMJ articles make clear that obedience is only required for lawful orders. Patently or manifestly illegal orders impose no duty of obedience on the service member and instead mandate disobedience. In fact, a service member who obeys an illegal order is individually culpable for the crime and cannot later assert ‘following orders’ as a defense.”

In fact, this mandate to disobey illegal orders is the result of, and in response to, far too many atrocities committed by those who were ‘just following orders.’ Both American and international courts have consistently found that there are human rights which are so protected, that to violate them in the pursuit of obedience simply cannot be allowed (Balfour, Adams, & Adams, 2014). The My Lai Massacre, the genocides of WWII, and the Abu Ghraib atrocities all have the same lesson: The presumption of obedience, such as that found in articles 90 and 92, cannot be used to justify torture, commit war crimes, or participate in other unconscionable activities. These are examples of the “manifestly illegal orders” contemplated within the UCMJ itself. 

#### Dissent

So, the implied ethic of unfailingly loyal obedience to orders is not even a truth in the most militaristic of settings – the military itself. It follows, then, that to apply that ethic in less structured environments is inappropriate as well. What then is the value of dissent in the American public service? Rosemary O’Leary (2013) covers this question with great depth. O’Leary is not pollyannish regarding dissent – she is not arguing it is always appropriate, or even good, and provides plenty of support for the idea that there is a “potential dark side of guerilla government” (2013, p. 126). However, it is in her willingness to accept the middle ground that she is so convincing (p. 118): “Just as it is difficult to argue that there is not a need for obedience by employees, it is difficult to argue overall that acting on one’s strongly held personal and spiritual beliefs in certain contexts is improper.” 

Most would agree that a public employee is not compelled by duty to obey obviously illegal orders, O’Leary is more comfortable in exploring the marginal cases where answers are not so clear, and concludes (p. 110) that “not all guerilla government is created equal” – some dissenters are “a canary in the coalmine” while others are simply “delusional single-issue” fanatics. O’Leary is comfortable in not finding some final, clear answer: “most cases are not so easy to judge” (p. 110) and the fact is (p. 117) that the “tensions inherent in guerilla government will never be resolved.” Her doubts are more convincing than the surety of those who suspect a robotic response by public employees.

Government needs to be efficient, and therefore needs to exert hierarchal control over employees in order to ensure that efficiency. However, hierarchal control inevitably clashes with the federalist priority on local autonomy (Elazar, 1984; Madison, 1787). As illustrated in the “Nevada Four” case (O’Leary, 2013, pp. 27–41), sprawling federal agencies must rely on employees who are local, and some of those front-line employees will eventually begin to prioritize what they see as important over dictates from their bureaucratic superiors in faraway offices, who may have never even been to the areas they are attempting to wrest control over.
While O’Leary does not argue all dissent is good, nor can dissent be so easily dismissed as inherently flawed, or that it does not hold an important place in public governance. Dissent is itself an American ideal (O’Leary, 2010; Ragosta, 2010; Sunstein, 2003). John Steinbeck (1952) captures this feature of Americana well: 

>“And this I believe: that the free, exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world. And this I would fight for: the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes, undirected. And this I must fight against: any idea, religion, or government which limits or destroys the individual. This is what I am and what I am about.” 

So long as there is an American government which employs Americans, there will be a need to find ways to include the dissenter in public service. 

#### Strategic Human Resources Management
In the past, the human resources responsibilities within a public organization were “warehoused” within one department. However, as strategic human resources management (SHRM) has become the new standard, and the more of the previously “core” responsibilities of HR have been shifted to the front-line managers and supervisors of the organization. These responsibilities include recruitment, development, and promotion of employees, which are conducted by supervisors with the HR department generally in an advisory and policy role.

Public administration authors have described best practices in new employee selection (Berman, Evan M., et al., 2015).

#### Differences in Managing Public & Private Organizations

Human resources management (HRM) has been defined as “all management decisions that affect the relationship between the organization and employees – its human resources” (Beer, et. al, 1985). Managing human capital in both private and public organizations has many of the same baseline tasks, and this essay focuses on two of them: recruitment of talent, and management of legal liabilities related to employees.  While these discrete tasks retain similar functions across the private and public spheres, the management of public organizations differs broadly in that public organizations are constrained by civil service legal obligations. While some civil service protections have been under attack over the last two decades, the core protections remain in place and continue to enhance the function of public organizations as a model employer.

Recruitment of employees to a public organization remains a core function of HRM. Compared to private sector management, in general public sector organizations differ in that the concept of civil service is central to the entire process. Civil service requirements are a positive, in that they demand the organization remain politically neutral, transparent, and committed to hiring the most professionally qualified. Of course, private sector employers want to hire the “best” candidate as well. However, they are not required by law to do so, and a private sector organization is allowed broad discretion in determining what factors go into deciding which candidate will be hired. For example, in a public organization there are clear prohibitions on nepotism, the hiring of employees based on familial relationships. However, in a private organization it is not unusual for the head of a firm to hire, groom, and eventually appoint a family member to lead the organization. This kind of nepotism is seen in private organizations from small firms to large organizations such as multi-billion conglomerate News Group, headed by Rupert Murdoch. In 2013, Mr. Murdoch appointed one son as deputy director of News Group and his other son as CEO of British Sky Broadcasting Group (a subsidiary of News Group). The protections afforded by the civil service requirements of public organizations is one of the strongest, and most positive, differences between public and private HRM, in that it prevents public organizations from becoming vehicles dedicated to personal dynasties.

Civil service requirements are not found only within the recruitment of new employees. Public HRM must also operate carefully in the discipline and firing of employees, which is affected by another aspect of civil service: due process, generally defined as the protections an employee has for continued employment. While a private sector employee is almost always an “at will employee,” and can be terminated for any, or no, reason, a public employee has a property interest in continued employment, and a public organization must show the employee has been given due process before stripping the employee of that property interest. While this property interest has been stripped in some sectors of government employment (Georgia, Florida, and Wisconsin for example), for the most part due process is still very much part of the public HRM landscape.  The due process requirements have historically been a bedrock principle of public employment and a positive aspect of the civil service. 

#### Current Trends in Public Workforces

The most significant trend in the current workforce is the impending generational shift as “Baby Boomers,” prepare to retire. Preparing our public organizations for this generational shift is among the most important strategic planning we can do. With careful planning and introduction of family/work programs, we can address the concerns of each generation, ensuring public employment remains an attractive option for each.

Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, are not simply retiring to a life of leisure. In fact, as their parents have reached advanced age, up to 35% of workers this age are responsible for providing elder care. This responsibility has been estimated to cost up to \$3 trillion in aggregate lost wages and support (Berman, Evan M., et al., 2015), up to $33 billion in lost productivity (Dobkin, 2007), and constitutes a tremendous time and financial burden on the caregiver.  In fact, up to 15% of employees faced with primary care of their elderly parents left the workforce (Dobkin, 2007). Public administrators, looking to keep some of their most experienced employees in the workforce as long as possible, should be looking at policies to help address this concern for baby boomers. 

By crafting formal “elder care” policies, such as those found at IBM, public administrators can begin to meet the challenge. IBM developed the nation’s first corporate elder care policy, as the company’s leaders recognized the increased burden and cost of the care to their employees. IBM offers management seminars to help their supervisory staff better understand and respond to their employees’ needs, up to six hours a year of paid elder-care-specific leave, external resource referrals, and even training on how to give better caregiving for the employee. Dobkin (2007) argues these are the types of low-cost interventions have high internal and external value, and help increase retention of employees who find themselves in the position of primary caregiver of an elderly family member.

Managing for different generational needs is a relevant topic for public managers to consider. The discussions and text readings on the subject reminded me of how important the shift is, especially in regards to the sheer numbers of Baby Boomers and Millennials versus Generation X employees.  With Generation X at approximately one-quarter the number in the other two generations combined, I begin to wonder at what the future of leadership in our organizations will look like. As the boomers retire, there are simply far fewer Generation X employees to advance to the unfilled positions, leaving organizations with a difficult choice: do we fill those positions with some relatively unskilled Generation X employees, or advance some hotshot Millennials who may have the skillsets, but lack the “wisdom” of life-experience to use those skills wisely? Of course, this is a wide-angle, strategic issue, and in any individual selection the optics may be different. But strategically, it appears organizations must start to come to terms with the idea that increased training and early mentorship may be the only answer.


#### Disparate Treatment versus Disparate Impact

“Disparate treatment” is intentional employment discrimination, based on a person’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. Known as Title VII protections, employers cannot make employment decisions based on these categories.  Title VII laws are decades old, and intentional discrimination relatively rare. However, under the theory of “disparate impact,” employers may also be held liable for employment decisions which have a negative, disproportionate effect on one of the protected Title VII classes. This theory is based in a 1971 US Supreme Court decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co. The court held that employers who make employment decisions which disproportionately affect a protected class can be held liable. This protection was further incorporated into the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

Employers, forced to respond to increasing numbers of both disparate treatment and disparate impact legal claims, increasingly relied on “bona fide occupational qualification,” or “BFOQ.” This legal defense relies on the employer’s claim that there is an essential job requirement which requires discriminate treatment. For example, while it is normally illegal to discriminate based on sex, a movie producer is allowed to audition only female performers for a female role in the film.

#### Law & Public Administration Case Study: Borough of Duryea, Pennsylvania, et al. v. Guarnieri

This case involves Charles Guarnieri, police chief (respondent), and the Borough of Duryea (petitioner). Chief Guarnieri was fired by the Borough, but an arbitrator later awarded the Chief his job back. Upon his return, the Borough issued a set of directives to the Chief setting out his duties, and also denied the Chief’s request for overtime. The Chief filed a second complaint, and again the arbitrator found mainly for the Chief, ordering some of the directives withdrawn and/or altered. The Chief then filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Borough, alleging he was being retaliated against for petitioning for his job back, in violation of the Petition Clause of the First Amendment.

The case began in a Federal District court, where the jury found for Chief Guarnieri. The Borough appealed to the Third Circuit Court, which upheld the jury’s decision, although the appeals court reversed punitive damages. The Borough appealed again to the US Supreme Court, which granted certiorari  (Borough of Duryea, Pa. V. Guarnieri, 2011).
The Court here is considering whether a public employee can sue their employer for retaliation under the First Amendment (petition clause) if the matter for which the employee was retaliated against was a private concern.
In a unanimous decision, the court held a public employee’s rights to petition are not violated when they petition for a private concern and are thereafter (allegedly) retaliated against. In the holding, the court decided:  “A government employer’s allegedly retaliatory actions against an employee do not give rise to liability under the Petition Clause unless the employee’s petition relates to a matter of public concern.”

The Court’s holding here protects the ability of public administrators to make the required daily personnel decisions without every decision being automatically turned into a constitutional fight overseen by courts. In protecting administrators’ ability to make personnel decisions, the Court also freed the lower court systems from being overwhelmed by lawsuits from employees upset with administrators’ decisions. 

The Court sidestepped an important question: whether a lawsuit constitutes a “petition” as set out in the First Amendment. The Court only answered whether the issue at stake must be public matter, versus a private matter, leaving administrators’ in the uncomfortable position of attempting to determine whether any future lawsuits can be construed as a “public matter.” For instance, does a lawsuit with more than one petitioner start to become more likely a “public” lawsuit? What about a union suing a public entity on behalf of its 2000 members, does that now become a “public matter”?

## Policy Frameworks and Police Technology: The Case of Body-Worn Cameras

### Introduction

The rapid adoption of body-worn cameras in American policing between 2014 and 2018 presents many exciting research questions. Top among those questions: How did up to 90% of the more than 18,000 individual police departments come to adopt the technology (Hyland, 2018) in such a short period? This essay will proceed in two sections. In the first section, three mapping exercises will explore the stakeholder, policy, and regulatory maps in police body-worn cameras. The second section continues as three policy frameworks are evaluated and applied to research questions involved in investigating the unforeseen effects of the technology, concluding with a critique of the most common theory applied in body-worn camera research, the theory of deterrence, which is a model of linear policy outcomes.

### Policy in Policing

Policing is an aspect of government that affects everyone in a community, whether or not an individual has direct contact with officers or not. The Bureau of Justice Statistics report on their triennial Police-Public Contact Survey (Davis, Whyde, & Langton, 2018) estimates that 53.5 million persons over age 16 – representing a fifth of the population of the same age – had direct contact of any kind with police officers in the previous twelve months.  The data suggests that every member of the community has a stake in policing, and can be considered at least a secondary stakeholder. 

Policing in the United States remains a state and local government affair predominantly, and with rare exception, police regulation is a function of municipal and county officials. The decision to implement body-worn cameras is typically made by the chief executives of an agency – either a police chief or county sheriff – along with local politicians such as mayors, city councils, and city managers. However, the rapid adoption of body-worn cameras by these policymakers is at least partially explained by the federal funding made available by President Obama in 2015, which set aside up to $75 million in grants to local agencies to purchase the equipment (Edwards, 2015). There is currently no federal regulatory agency charged with overseeing body-worn cameras. In some cases, the Department of Justice has required body-worn cameras as part of consent decrees with agencies operating under their auspices (Newark Police, 2018). Still, this type of federal oversight accounts for a vanishingly small number of the more than 18,000 police agencies in the U.S., let alone those that have adopted body-worn cameras.

While the stakeholder map above suggests there are a large number of primary and secondary stakeholders in body-worn camera policy, the reality of American policing has precluded national policy and regulation. Except for the funding mechanism pushed by President Obama in 2015, there is no other national policy to turn attention to in the body-worn camera policy environment. Because of the balkanized nature of policing in the United States, constructing a clear policy and regulatory map is impossible at this time. The most robust tracking of body-worn camera policy at the state and municipal level is done by The Leadership Council on Civil and Human Rights (LCCHR). The LCCHR report – titled “BWC Scorecard,” (Yu, Cook, & Paluch, 2017) – tracks a number of measures related to body-worn cameras. These measures include whether individual agencies are funded by the Department of Justice, have a policy available to the public, allow officer discretion in camera activation, protect privacy, allow officer review of footage, prohibit footage misuse, allow public access to footage, and limits the use of biometric technologies (such as facial recognition). 

While robust, the policy tracker is limited in that it has not been updated in over a year, likely due to the overwhelming task of tracking this kind of information. A further limitation is that the measures used are strongly influenced by the LCCHR organizational values, which are tied to their “Civil Rights Principles on Body-Worn Cameras” statement (Yu et al., 2017, p. 322). The values in that statement tie certain policies to “civil rights” positions which have changed dramatically since they were first constructed in May 2015. Just one example is the demand that police departments “consider individual privacy concerns before making footage available to broad audiences” (p. 322). While my research position agrees with this assessment (I. Adams & Mastracci, 2017), the majority of policy research in this area equates broad availability of body-worn camera footage to be a public good which increases transparency and accountability. Regardless, the assessment of the BWC Scorecard that certain departments are “failing” to implement a specific policy should be evaluated against the values bias of the organization, as it is likely there is a policy, but it happens not to include the policy prescriptions prized by LCCHR. 

At the state level, some legislatures have mandated that all agencies within their jurisdiction use body-worn cameras. Nevada passed such a law in 2017 (Whaley, 2017), which ordered all police departments to equip officers with the technology by July 1, 2018. Here locally, the Utah legislature has relatively little guidance on police use of body-worn cameras, requiring only that the agency have a policy guiding their use (if they are implemented) and that the cameras be used during forced-entry warrants (again, if the agency has implemented the cameras). The Utah legislature also passed rules prohibiting police officers from using body-worn cameras in hospitals unless for a “normal” police call (Gessel, 2017), and protecting any footage (under HIPPA and GRAMA guidance) which is recorded to restrict its distribution. These context-based rules are among the most common type of state legislation related to body-worn cameras, with lawmakers aiming to regulate and restrict how the cameras are used, how the resulting footage is distributed, how long the footage is stored, and if the public has a presumption of access to the footage (Lei, 2018). 

### Policy Frameworks

Any number of theoretical frameworks can be fruitfully applied to the research questions presented by police body-worn cameras. To date, research into the effects of body-worn cameras has been focused on testing theories of deterrence, most with a focus on testing empirical data at the department and community level. However, within this paper, I will concentrate on three which I believe are most useful for addressing specific research questions: What are the unintended effects of police body-worn cameras on communities, people, and organizations?

### Social Construction of Target Populations

In the third quarter earnings call by corporate leaders of Axon Enterprise, Inc., the largest manufacturer of police body-worn cameras in the world, CEO and founder Patrick “Rick” Smith explained why the company made the “core functionality” of Axon Records free to police agencies (Axon, 2018, p. 4): “We see the real value in Records is in the data, not in the form-filling software. We have the largest data set in public safety. We're now at over 40 petabytes—that's 40 million gigabytes.” What are the implications of a single corporate actor retaining the data of government? How do policymakers and the public ensure such data is used appropriately (if any use is allowed at all), including body-worn camera footage? Unfortunately, the academy has been almost silent on these issues, which are appropriately investigated by policy and public administration scholars.

One way to inquire into a policy is to examine the silences and assumptions within it (Foucault, 1991), and social construction of target population (SCTP) theory (A. Schneider & Ingram, 1993) can help explain how body-worn camera implementation has disproportionately affected different stakeholders. One such considerable silence in both the academic and popular literatures has been the big data, big technology implications of body-worn cameras. The questions raised by huge, persistent databases of body-worn camera footage, biometric technologies, and disproportionate uses of the cameras in communities of color have all been mostly overlooked, and as a result, few policy solutions have been proposed, let alone implemented.

Between 2012 and 2018, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu contracted with big data analytics firm Palantir, using the company’s predictive policing technology to address the city’s murder rate, which was sixth highest in the nation.  The partnership between city government and private sector big data provides fertile ground for the public policy questions swirling around the big data, algorithmic bias, and the future of public service work. On the one hand, the partnership was born and lived in secrecy, and the powers of surveillance it granted were out of balance with what is commonly expected for local government. As one critic summed up, "It’s almost as if New Orleans were contracting its own version of the NSA to conduct 24/7 surveillance of the lives of its people,” (Winston, 2018). 

Big data influences how, who, and where we police (Ferguson, 2017). The policy questions posed by the rapid rise of big data across public agencies, including police agencies, have been slow to gather the scholarly attention needed to shape the policy answers effectively. In a recent editorial in Public Administration Review, Paul Battaglio and Jeremy Hall warn about the expanding gap between the use of technology and public administration values (2018, p. 826), with risks to “privacy and performance as decisions are increasingly autonomous, and as technological advances outpace government’s ability to regulate them.”

The widening of police surveillance tactics risks “transforming police officers’ bodies into mobile surveillance tools” (I. Adams & Mastracci, 2017) and is a crucial ethical challenge to be addressed by public administration scholars. Gary Marx (1998) is admirable for his far-seeing scholarship focused on structuring ethical approaches to surveillance, and his work is well-suited to help public administration scholars address the questions posed by government’s use of big data. While Marx’ twenty-nine questions to interrogate the ethics of surveillance are too long to replicate here, his insistence on respecting the dignity of the individual, and focusing on the means, context, and conditions of data collection is a useful place to begin policy inquiries into government surveillance, body-worn cameras, and big data.

### Multiple Streams analysis

The sharp rise of body-camera adoption in a relatively short period of time suggests punctuated equilibrium (PE) theory (Baumgartner et al., 2009; True, Jones, & Baumgartner, 1999) as an understandable framework to turn to, but in the end PE relies too strongly on assumptions of rational, linear theory. Multiple streams analysis (MSA), first put forth by John Kingdon (1995) contains many of the advantages of PE, while deviating from linearity and offering a more compelling way to conceptualize the complexity of policy. MSA remains one of the most cited policy theories and is a “key influence on the study of public policy” (Cairney & Jones, 2016, p. 1).

A strength of MSA is its focus on “policy entrepreneurs,” which in the context of body-worn cameras appears important in explaining the rapid adoption of the technology across the United States. MSA is best known for the metaphor of three “streams” within the policy process – the problem stream, the politics stream, and the policy stream. Within the broad policy environment, these three policy streams do no often align. When they do align – “naturally” or more often with the assistance of policy entrepreneurs – policy change can happen.
Policy entrepreneurs are the individuals and organizations who recognize when there is an opportunity to bring the MSA streams into sync with one another, in pursuit of a preferred policy outcome. In the case of body-worn cameras, one critical policy entrepreneur is the company Axon Enterprise, Inc. (formerly Taser International), the largest manufacturer of police body-worn cameras in the world, and owner of the repository for the vast majority of footage recorded by police body-worn cameras (Axon, 2018). 

The American tale of body-worn cameras begins with an incident for which there was no video. In August 2014, Michael Brown was killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, witness accounts of the incident were broadcast widely, and as witnesses recounted Michael Brown being shot on his knees, or with his hands in the air, or both, the incident quickly picked up national urgency. Despite contemporary witness accounts being later disproven or retracted during the most extensive federal investigation into a police shooting in modern history, the belief that Michael Brown was the victim of racist police brutality was soon turned to rage as Ferguson and nearby St. Louis were the site of widespread rioting and protest. Into this context, President Obama announced the formation of the President’s Taskforce on 21st Century Policing. The final report of the taskforce (Office of COPS, 2015) called for the adoption of body-worn cameras by policing agencies, and as President Obama announced the findings of the task force he simultaneously announced federal funding of $75 million dollars to assist agencies in purchasing the camera hardware.

The announcement of federal dollars was a boon for Axon, which had so far had limited success in selling the technology to police agencies. At the time, less than 25% of agencies had even experimented with the cameras in testing scenarios (Miller & Toliver, 2014), and only one academic study (the “Rialto Study”) of body-worn cameras had been published (Ariel, Farrar, & Sutherland, 2015), the results of which showed substantial reduction in the use of force by police. Despite no other study being able to reproduce the results of the Rialto study, media coverage of the study was intense (Schneider, 2017), and the report was highlighted in the President’s taskforce report (Office of COPS, 2015). 

Even with federal funding, increased public demand for transparency, some academic research support, Axon still needed to convince police executives that body-worn cameras were a viable policy solution. Separate investigations by The New York Times (Gelles, 2017), the Wall Street Journal (Frosch & Elinson, 2016), alleged that Axon had “bought” their way to domination of the market through expensive trips and post-retirement jobs for police chiefs who pushed through non-competitive bids in the wake of the 2015 federal funding. The Associated Press (Foley, 2015) connected Salt Lake City Police Department head Chief Chris Burbank to the scandal, though Chief Burbank insisted his selection of Taser (later Axon) as the sole body-camera supplier through a non-competitive bid had nothing to do with personal gain.
Axon continues to maintain their practices were “commonplace” despite competitors alleging the company awarding police chiefs “lucrative contracts after they retire” (Gelles, 2017, pp. 31). Regardless, Axon was successful in dominating the market and is estimated to control approximately 75% of the nearly \$1 billion per year in American police agency spending on body-worn cameras (Gelles, 2017). Understanding the company’s moves to control the market in the wake of a crisis is a classic example of policy entrepreneurship. The company had a pre-existing solution and recognized a moment when the policy stream (federal funding), the problem stream (public demand for accountability), and politics stream (presidential taskforce call for cameras, support from nonprofit and advocacy organizations). In recognizing the streams had converged, Axon aggressively marketed their “solution” by implementing a sales strategy of making the cameras free to departments and charging instead for their storage solution for the resulting petabytes of camera footage. Axon body-worn camera contracts for  large agencies are expensive, with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department planning \$84 million over five years (Times Editorial, 2018), while the New York Police Department pays \$6.4 million per year for 3,000 cameras (Southall, 2018), and Philadelphia signed a four-year, $12.5 million agreement with Axon without even consulting competitors (Allyn, 2017).

The flexibility of multiple streams analysis is useful when examining body-cameras and their rapid adoption, but the theory’s strength is in understanding events in a post-hoc analysis and it not predictive, doing little to prove or disprove the hoped-for effects of the cameras – to reduce police use-of-force. The rational man underpinnings of those hopes were validated in the Rialto Study (Ariel et al., 2015), but have been challenged in other large research studies (Yokum, Ravishankar, & Coppock, 2017), sometimes even by the same researchers (Ariel et al., 2016, 2018). Understanding how the rational man framework of deterrence theory is key to understanding how even rigorous experimental studies can fail to establish consistent results. 

### The Rational Man, Linear Theory, and Deterrence

In the context of body-worn cameras, public and policymaker beliefs regarding police use-of-force and academic misapplication of the theory of deterrence both contributed to the turn to body-worn cameras. Incidents involving the use of force account for less than 1% of interactions between police officers and the public (Lersch & Mieczkowski, 2005), and incidents of unlawful (excessive) force only a small fraction of those incidents. As tricky as establishing how often police use force, attempting to define (and thus count) excessive force incidents in research “may be impossible to answer, however, because applications of definitions to incidents will always be open to challenge” (K. Adams, 1996, p. 53). This difference equates to more than sophistry and interpretation. 

Deterrence theory is centuries old (Beccaria, 1764), and forms the basis for mainline body-worn camera research. Simply put, deterrence theory expects to alter police use-of-force with the expectation that officers will rationally respond to camera surveillance by following the rules when they believe they are being observed, and that detection of rule-breaking is likely (Nagin, 2013). Body-camera researchers propose that the cameras act to ensure that the probability of apprehension for officers using illegitimate force is high, thus “deterring” them from such unlawful acts. As “the degree of deterrence increases, officers are less likely to use force” (Ariel, Sutherland, Henstock, Young, & Sosinski, 2017, p. 2). 

This theoretical stance is problematic at the conceptual and operational level – police officers do not consider use-of-force to be an illegitimate behavior, and therefore are not likely to be deterred from it. To be sure, there may be a deterrent effect on illegitimate and excessive force, but that is not what is being measured by body-camera researchers, and may explain why the most extensive experimental study of body-camera outcomes to date – the Washington DC study  – did not detect a single statistically significant effect on any outcome, including use-of-force, prompting the authors to conclude “we should recalibrate our expectations” (Yokum, Ravishankar, & Coppock, 2017, p. 22) regarding body-worn cameras.

The failures of the rational man approach to body-worn cameras are evident in the equivocal research record since the Rialto Study (Ariel et al., 2015). While four works have shown statistically significant reduction in use-of-force by police officers wearing the cameras (Braga, Sousa, Coldren Jr, & Rodriguez, 2018; Henstock & Ariel, 2017; Jennings, Fridell, Lynch, Jetelina, & Reingle Gonzalez, 2017; Jennings, Lynch, & Fridell, 2015), none of the studies have established a magnitude of effect similar to the ones found in Rialto. Contrasting those three reports are the eight since the Rialto Study which have not found a reduction in use-of-force  (Ariel et al., 2016; Braga, Barao, McDevitt, & Zimmerman, 2018; Headley, Guerette, & Shariati, 2017; Peterson, Yu, La Vigne, & Lawrence, 2018; Stratton, Clissold, & Tuson, 2015; Toronto Police Service, 2016; White, Gaub, & Todak, 2017; Yokum et al., 2017), and in at least one (Ariel et al., 2016) the authors find that not only is there no reduction in police use-of-force, but assaults on officers rose 15%. 

### Conclusion

Overall, the picture emerging from body-worn camera research is that “the anticipated effects of [body-worn cameras] have been overestimated” (Lum, Stoltz, Koper, & Scherer, 2019). Despite the mixed research record, the reality is that body-worn cameras are here, and are likely to stay a part of the American police officer’s toolkit. Future research to uncover the silences in what outcomes are researched, and what is not, is key to understanding the full effect of the technology. 


## *Dune* and Public Administration Theory

> I include this one because it's important to keep some writings that are a bit 'off-the-wall' ready to employ. I never did manage to use this anywhere, but it was more fun to write at the time than another electoral theory piece!

“Do not depend only on theory if your life is at stake.”
Bene Gesserit commentary
*Chapterhouse: Dune*

Universally lauded at the time of its publication in 1965, Frank Herbert’s novel Dune won the Nebula Award in 1965. Considered among the best American speculative fiction novels, Dune is the best-selling science fiction novel of all time. Susan McLean presents the novel Dune well, “[Herbert] suggests that the human longing for absolutes...is doomed to failure because any tendency carried to the extreme will eventually lead to its opposite.” This paper will attempt to supplement McLean’s idea of balance through a focus on political leadership and gender politics, seen through several classic theories in the field of public administration. I begin with an examination of whether Dune provides a fitting “canvas” upon which we can draw lessons of politics and administration. I will then continue with the primary examinations of political leadership and gender politics in the novel.

First, by examining Dune as essentially a political novel, the issue of leadership in the political context will be examined through the public administration theories of Douglas McGregor, Woodrow Wilson, Frank Goodnow, and A.H. Maslow. The second main thrust of this paper will directly address one of the core themes of Dune: gender politics. Using the ideas set forth by Camilla Stivers in her book Bureau Men, Settlement Women: Constructing Public Administration in the Progressive Era, this paper uncovers direct similarities between two organizations: the settlement women in Stiver’s work and the Bene Gesserit in Herbert’s.

### Dune as Political Novel

	This paper is not the first to draw connections between science fiction and the study of politics. Science fiction critic Clyde Wilcox commented, “Science fiction allows political scientists to expand their thinking about the ways that different cultures develop different politics. ... Such thought experiments can stretch the imagination, and help us rethink our theories, categories, and hopes.” The field of science fiction can be seen as the literature of ideas, or as writer Kingsley Amis wrote, “Idea as hero.”
	
	Dune, sitting atop this literature of ideas, is a novel which takes place on the desert planet Arrakis, aka “Dune.” Arrakis is the sole source of “melange,” or “spice,” which sustains a galactic empire in decline. This spice is at the center of the byzantine House politics, intrigue, religious war, and gender clash fleshed out in the novel. Spice is effectively a stand-in for “power,” in all the different connotations of the word. Thus “politics” both small and large are at the center of the novel.  As Kevin Mulcahy observes, “There is in Dune an explicit and conscious engagement with political issues.”
	
### Paul Atreides, aka the “Kwisatz Haderach” 

The hero of Dune is Paul Atreides, and he will be examined in some detail throughout this paper. The heir to the House of Atreides, he is raised in a privileged space before becoming the prophesied messiah figure, the “Kwisatz Haderach.” Literary critic Scott Sanders writes that science fiction is the “home of invisible men and women” and the field as a whole “reproduces the experience of living in a regimented, rationalized society, within which the individual has become anonymous: persons are interchangeable...the individual is subordinated to the system.” Herbert introduces Paul Atreides within that context, an adolescent whose own desires are subjugated to the expectations of his father Duke Leto Atreides, the needs of his family, and the desires of the empire. However, Paul rises above expectations, becoming the Kwisatz Haderach and eventually leading a native tribesfolk (the “Fremen”) into jihad, gaining independence for the natives from the Empire by controlling the spice upon which it depends. 

### Dune and the Administrative State

The worlds of Dune are ruled by aristocratic families, comprising the Empire. Byzantine court politics reminiscent of those found in middle history Europe rule the political landscape. The administration of such a power structure is predictably bureaucratic, relying on a very strict chain-of-command. Woodrow Wilson would have recognized much in Dune, especially his statement “all sovereigns are suspicious of their servants.” During a conversation with his father, Duke Leto Atreides, Paul Atreides is told: “Give as few orders as possible. Once you’ve given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on that subject.” 

But whereas his elders may rely on simply giving orders and trusting in their autocratic bureaucracy, Paul sees government differently, implicitly understanding administration will be required. Paul states, “A plan depends as much on execution as it does upon concept.” Woodrow Wilson would recognize Paul’s impulse. In his foundational text “The Study of Administration,” Wilson writes: “Administration is...government in action.” Wilson again: “Public administration is the detailed and systematic execution of public law.” A quarter-century later, Frank Goodnow echoes Wilson, drawing a distinction between politics and administration: “Politics has to do with policies or expressions of the state will. Administration has to do with the execution of these policies.”

The elite ruling class in Dune does not see in its workers any ability to rise above their station. In a particularly telling sequence, the main antagonist Baron Vladamir Harkonnenn seems pleased with himself as he readies his army for battle against House Atreides: 
“The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.” 

Both Duke Atreides and Baron Harkonnen’s view of leadership is clearly “Theory X,” as Douglas McGregor explains the basic beliefs of that theory: “The average man is by nature indolent--he works as little as possible. He lacks ambition, dislikes responsibility, prefers to be led. He is gullible, not very bright, the ready dupe of the charlatan and the demagogue.” However, true to McLean’s observation regarding Dune’s focus on balance, Paul’s approach to leadership is not limited to an autocratic, bureaucratic style. He is tutored from a young age not only by his father the Duke, but by various teachers, including Thufir Hawat, a “mentat” or human computer (a deeper discussion of mentats is included later in this paper). Whereas the Duke identifies “power and fear” as the “tools of statecraft,” Thufir Hawat teaches Paul that, “A ruler must learn to persuade, not compel.” 

Further conflicting Paul is a lesson from another of his tutors, and religious leader, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother: 
“Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things..." she held up four big-knuckled fingers. "...the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these things are as nothing..." She closed her fingers into a fist. "...without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!” 

These conflicting lessons are in fact Herbert’s attempt to allow the reader to see the different forces which will eventually be fused together as Paul Atreides becomes the messiah figure, the Kwisatz Haderach. Paul synthesizes this “art of ruling,” diverting from his father’s traditional view of “power and fear.”  

In both the Reverend Mother’s and Thufir’s maxims we see McGregor’s “Theory Y” move to the forefront, relying on leaders who do not simply sit atop a bureaucratic machine of rabbits and humming bees, moving the machinery of people through power and fear. Instead Paul is being taught a competing type of leadership, where people matter, and where motivation and persuasion are more effective in accomplishing the leader’s goals. McGregor explains this theory is not the abdication of responsibility, but the willingness of the manager (in Herbert’s context: royal leadership) to engage and participate. Whereas Baron Harkonnen sees his “bees” humming along from afar, atop a parapet, Paul eventually flees into the desert, inserting himself among the native Fremen. There he takes a wife among the Fremen, trains in their guerilla warfare tactics, and leads them into battle at the head of their army. Along the way he improves what McGregor would characterize as their living conditions, their physiological and safety needs. Where the Baron is a distant manager, Paul is in the midst of his men practicing participation and allowing self-direction.

Of course, the conflicting maxims and proverbs taught to a young Paul Atreides would no doubt severely disappoint Herbert Simon, who questioned the usefulness of such statements in his essay “The Proverbs of Administration.” After all Simon argued, what use are proverbs when they explain everything, and yet nothing at all? Simon saw the use of proverbs not as decision making devices, but as a convenient tool of self-justification: “If it is a matter of rationalizing behavior that has already been decided upon, proverbs are ideal. Since one is never at a loss to find one that will prove his point -- or the precisely contradictory point, for that matter -- they are a great help in persuasion, political debate, and all forms of rhetoric.” Paul would not see Simon’s critique as too useful however, as Paul needs persuasion and rhetorice on his journey.

Frank Herbert eventually develops Paul’s leadership approach as a balance, for as a leader of the Fremen, Paul abandons neither power nor fear, using both to great effect. However, Paul also uses insights into human needs and desires to both motivate his own Fremen forces, and bring ruin to his Empire enemies. In his paper “A Theory of Human Motivation,” A.H. Maslow identifies a hierarchical theory of human motivation, with physiologic and safety needs comprising the base needs. Maslow identifies “self-actualization” as the highest need a man can obtain: “What a man can be, he must be.” Paul’s need to transform into the Kwisatz Haderach is a direct example of this self-actualization. But if he is to obtain that status, he must first enlist the Fremen to his cause, and destroy the Empire’s ability to pillage Arrakis.

Perfectly adapted to the austere desert planet, the Fremen care only for water, and using Maslow’s analysis, are therefore motivated by the same. Conversely, the Empire is only on Dune in order to harvest spice, which functions in the Dune universe as a stand-in for power. Spice allows interstellar travel for the Empire, grants the Bene Gesserit (described in some detail later in this paper) their mind-reading and other super-human powers, and the Mentat their ability to function as human super-computers. Maslow would argue that both spice and water function as  base physiologic needs, and until they are satisfied no other higher needs can be met. Herbert recognizes this, and in fact the base needs or both people and organization's for water and spice drive all other political dramas which unfold during the novel. 

Directly addressing the Fremen’s desire for freedom from Empire domination, Maslow comments on “esteem needs” in the notes section of his essay: 

>“Whether or not this particular desire is universal we do not know. The crucial question, especially important today, is ‘Will men who are enslaved and dominated inevitably feel dissatisfied and rebellious?’ We may assume...that a man who has known true freedom...will not willingly or easily allow his freedom to be taken away from him. But we do not know that this is true for the person born into slavery.” 

Herbert, through Paul Atreides, answers Maslow’s question. The Fremen, exploited for centuries by an Empire who values them only as slaves and laborers, turn to Paul in their struggle for self-direction and freedom.

By the end of the novel Paul Atreides has completed his inner and outer journey, and is the messiah figure, the Kwisatz Haderach. This title has been thought to be a derivation of the Hebrew phrase kefitzat haderech, which is literally translated as “to shorten the way.” In becoming the Kwisatz Haderach, Paul is the only character to achieve what Maslow would describe as “self actualization,” in which “an individual is doing what he is fitted for.” Paul, the product of a millennia-long breeding program planned by the Bene Gesserit, is not only doing what he is fitted for, he is then elevated above any base needs, “shortening the way” towards enlightenment, above all spice, water, or other needs.

### Bene Gesserit, the Guild, and Mentats: Gender in Dune

Dune has been critiqued by feminist writers almost since its inception. First-wave feminist critics found the novel especially wanting. Writers such as Kathy Gower argued the female characters in Dune appear with less frequency than men, and in her view the women are relegated to “passive mothers of men,” given only to “domestic duties.”

This paper will argue that critiques such as those offered by Gower are overly simplistic and ignore Herbert’s treatment of the Bene Gesserit as a character of its own, standing equal with and sometimes above the male dominated power structures sharing the stage. Three “schools” in the Dune universe serve as examples of the gender dynamics of the novel.

#### The “Fulcrum” and the Schools

Frank Herbert writes in Dune: “Schools were started to train human talents... The Guild... emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs... politics.” The organization known as the Bene Gesserit dominates the political landscape in Dune. “An ancient and mysterious order of women, the Bene Gesserit train (almost exclusively female) acolytes in diplomacy, espionage, sex, martial arts, lie detection, and mind control.” The Emperor's primary advisor, the “Truthsayer,” is the Reverend Mother, head of the Bene Gesserit, and his wife is an acolyte as well. The hero Paul’s mother Jessica Atreides is a high ranking member, and has an incredible influence on him throughout the novel, training him in Bene Gesserit ways against the orders of her leadership. The Bene Gesserit both create and destroy royal Houses through minutely planned machinations. The Kwisatz Haderach, a messiah prophecy fulfilled by Paul, is the result of a breeding program controlled and planned by the Bene Gesserit for millennia. Far from being the weak “mother figures” criticized by early authors, women stand atop the power structure, guiding mostly guileless men towards their own ends. 

The Guild is a male-dominated school, playing foil in some ways to the Bene Gesserit. The male-dominated Guild is a space travel monopoly, charged with development of pure mathematical analysis in its pilots, who are responsible for interstellar travel and the movement of goods across the empire. Like the Bene Gesserit and the Mentats, the Guild pilots rely on spice for their duties. This mutual reliance on a limited product produces a zero-sum game of politics, and this struggle is the heart of conflict in the Dune universe. Spice is power, and the struggle for both is played out through the organizational gender dynamics set up by Herbert.

In addition to his training at the hands of his Bene Gesserit mother, Paul is also trained by tutors from the “Mentat” school. The Mentats are best understood as human computers, highly desired due to an Empire-wide ban on “thinking machines” after a historical war between Empire and robotic enemies. As the Bene Gesserit represent a female-only organization, the Mentats are exclusively male. 

Author David M. Miller considered Herbert’s approach to gender, and how the author reconciles both power and gender exclusively in Paul Atreides. Miller writes in Frank Herbert: “Paul has been trained in disparate disciplines: mentat (male) and Bene Gesserit (female). Thus Paul’s early training prepares him to be androgynous, for his mother pursues the Bene Gesserit goal: To breed a Kwisatz Haderach who will have access to both male and female genetic memory.”

While Miller approaches Herbert with more sophistication than other authors, he misses the mark with seeing androgyny as the goal. Paul is trained in both Bene Gesserit and Mentat techniques, preparing him not as a gender-neutral hero, but a gender-optimized one, fluent in the best of male and female traits to be a revolutionary leader in a time of empire-wide decline. Herbert’s text offers a clear response to critics in a pivotal scene in which Paul Atreides has achieved his penultimate status as Kwisatz Haderach. His mother Jessica, having trained him in Bene Gesserit ways, confronts her son, setting up a clear example of Paul’s balancing of gender dynamics: 

> Paul said: “There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it’s almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed…These things are so ancient within us…that they’re ground into each separate cell of our bodies…It’s as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking.”
> 	“And you my son,” Jessica asked, “Are you the one who gives or the one who takes?”
> 	“I am the fulcrum,” he said.

Frank Herbert, in an epigraph from another religious text in the Dune universe, makes Paul’s place of balance even more explicit later. He writes: “How to define the Kwisatz Haderach? The male who is everywhere simultaneously, the only man who can truly become the greatest human of all of us, mingling masculine and feminine ancestry with inseparable power.”

### Stiver’s Settlement Women and Herbert’s Bene Gesserit

Camilla Stivers book, Bureau Men, Settlement Women: Constructing Public Administration in the Progressive Era offers a gender based analysis of public administration. Stivers convincingly argues the methods and accomplishments of the settlement women were effectively ignored by scholars, and puts forth an alternative frame to the “scientific” (i.e. bureau men) study of public administration adopted by traditional theorists. Stiver’s recounting of the settlement women offers a compelling lens through which we can examine the women of Dune’s Bene Gesserit.

In her discussion of Hull House, among the most famous of the settlement houses, Stivers quotes British Fabian socialist Beatrice Webb in a diary entry: “...the residents consist in the main of strong-minded, energetic women, bustling about their various enterprises and professions, interspersed with earnest-faced, self-subordinating and mild-mannered men who slide from room to room apologetically.” Herbert describes the Bene Gesserit similarly, women of great energy and power, guiding the men around them towards the organization's goals.

As Stivers points out, the settlement women were responsible for development of the survey method of research, but credit was inaccurately given to the bureau men. Similarly, the Bene Gesserit planned for and conducted genetic research for millennia, only to have the final product (Paul) stolen and credit for his success given to the male dominated Noble House structure, i.e. his father, Lord Atreides. Stivers points out, “...the residents of Chicago’s Hull House conducted the first full-blown social survey in the United States.”  She furthers the point that bureau men took credit for the work of settlement women: “..it is likely that several ideas that became central to the research bureau movement had their origins in settlement houses.”

In both Herbert’s and Stiver’s works, roles in society and governance are split along gender lines. Stivers writes: “...men and women who shared a commitment to public service found themselves organizing into separate professions-- the men in public administration, the women in social work.” Similarly in Dune, the most powerful women have organized into the Bene Gesserit, and the most powerful men into Mentats, Guild pilots, and political leaders. The comparison between Bene Gesserit and settlement women sharpens when we consider the faction of Bene Gesserit known as the Missionaria Protectiva. This faction is tasked with going into the local tribes of various worlds, including Dune, and cultivating religious beliefs in messiah figures consistent with Bene Gesserit goals. On Dune, this is accomplished through the indigenous tribes, known collectively as the “Fremen”. The women of the Missionaria are sent out to live among the tribes to conduct their studies and implement the goals of the Bene Gesserit.

This is comparable with the settlement womens’ beliefs. “For settlement residents, physical location in the neighborhoods they served made possible their brand of science. They operated on the premise that ‘only that which is lived can be understood and translated to others.’” The settlement women believed that “Science demanded...the kind of sympathy that came only from intimate knowledge of neighborhood life and thought.” This allowed the settlement women to know first-hand the neighborhoods at what Stivers calls the “micro level.” This close physical placement within the community in turn made possible what settlement resident Katherine Bement Davis described as knowledge learned, “block by block-- learning the location of all the public buildings, the charitable agencies, the schools, the saloons, the disorderly houses,” all of which allowed the settlement women to know “in some instances better than the police, what each house represented.”

Returning to the Mentats, gender foils of the Bene Gesserit, we can see another interplay with Stiver’s work. The Mentats are human computers, valuing numerical efficiency above all else, whereas the Bene Gesserit often rely on “genetic memory,” mind-reading, and emotional manipulation. As Mentat Piter De Vries states, “I let emotion cloud reason. Bad policy for a Mentat.” 
Stivers would see much wrong with the Mentats’ exclusive focus on numerical efficiency. She critiques the bureau mens’ similar short-sightedness: 

> “Suffused with a faith in science, in the power of facts to sway people’s minds, the bureau men never understood why the world somehow failed to fall in line. Quintessential expert rationalizers and systemizers, they could not acknowledge how fundamentally public life entails the non-rational and non-systematic, or where the appropriate boundaries of their expertise lay.”

In the Mentats’ failure to understand anything outside their narrow world-view, we can see echoes of what Stivers characterizes as the bureau mens’ focus on “rational structures and efficient procedures [which] would contribute to the public good by reducing corruption and saving money.” The bureau mens’ narrow focus on efficiency and “scientific” research is contrasted with the settlement womens’ focus on a more sophisticated understanding of community good. This contrast is a central theme of Stiver’s book.  The settlement women saw their work as “public motherhood” and “municipal house-keeping,” and had a goals which encompassed far more than simple numerical efficiency. Herbert does not necessarily raise one value over another, relying on Paul’s balance between the gendered groups to make his final argument instead.

### Conclusion

Stivers is especially critical of a continuing reliance on what she sees as the bureau mens’ outsized influence of the study of public administration: “As long as scientific legitimacy, defined in terms derived from the laboratory and the controlled experiment, is the first goal of a professional field, adherents will exhaust themselves trying vainly to make life conform to the standards of science, rather than working to put science to the service of life.”

Herbert echoes Stiver’s sentiment with an entry in Dune from the “Orange Catholic Bible,” described as the primary orthodox religious text of the Bene Gesserit, when he writes in a chapter preamble: “Scientists seek the lawfulness of events. It is the task of Religion to fit man into this lawfulness.” In Herbert’s construction, “Religion” is in fact the organization known as the Bene Gesserit, and in the end they prevail in obtaining the Kwisatz Haderach, the final balance between man and law, religion and numbers. 

Dune’s own text provides the answer to feminist critics concerned with only how often female characters appear in relation to men. Paul Atreides, the fulcrum of “masculine and feminine ancestry with inseparable power,” the Kwisatz Haderach stands as Herbert’s final answer to those critics who found Dune’s gender politics wanting. 

## "At Will" Employment (Human Resources Management)

“Employment at Will” (EAW) is just one aspect of civil service reform, and is commonly understood by researchers as stripping employees of their property interest in their employment (Gertz, 2007; Battaglio Jr. and Condrey, 2009). This fundamental change removes much of the due process traditionally expected in human resource management, especially in cases of workplace discipline and firings (Hays and Sowa, 2007; Battaglio Jr. and Condrey, 2006). A belief that the public sector would benefit from private sector employment practices led to adoption of EAW first in Sunbelt states such as Georgia and Florida, as well as more limited implementation in Wisconsin (Jordan and Battaglio Jr., 2014). Early experimentation at the state level has led to some very limited Federal adoption of EAW (Battaglio Jr. and Condrey, 2006).

Proponents argued this would  give agencies more flexibility due to complaints of “time delays to fill positions, cumbersome procedures, massive paperwork, and a protracted appeals process.” -- (West, 2002). Critics of this strategy worry that without merit status, public employees are more susceptible to political pressure, and are less likely to speak “truth to power.” Following reforms efforts in Kentucky, one author found a quick return to the patronage system, although the traditional merit protections appeared to have protected the system in the end (Koven, 2007).

Despite strong beliefs from pundits on both sides, there was little research on the impact of EAW on public employees themselves (Bowman and West, 2006; Rubin and Kellough, 2011). In our review of the literature on the outcomes of EAW, we have focused on the research focused on the reform’s employee-centered results. Studies of perceived organizational support have found employees form opinions regarding how their employers value their contribution and care about their well-being, and that employees “repay” organizational support with increased performance (Eisenberger, et al., 1986). As perceived organizational support decreases, so does performance.

### EAW’s Effect on Managerial and Organizational Trust

Managerial flexibility is the cornerstone of EAW reforms, and the employee perceptions regarding the “good intentions” of managers in public organizations can become important. While research by Battaglio Jr. and Condrey (2009) found that in Georgia employee’s were generally initially receptive to the aims of EAW, over time became more distrustful of both managers and the organization itself. The same researchers reported this decline in managerial and organizational trust was the result of employees seeing the return of spoils-era-type excesses such as patronage appointments (Battaglio Jr. and Condrey, 2009; see also Koven, 2007).

### EAW’s Effect on Turnover and Burnout 

Employee turnover within public organizations can have significant impact on service delivery and organization's. Turnover is associated with increased hiring costs and other economic costs, and has been correlated with increased employe burnout, work-related stress, and other negative psychosocial impacts (Allisey, Amanda F., et al., 2013). 

“Burnout” is the phenomenon of employees experiencing heightened emotional exhaustion, feelings of depersonalization, and a lack of personal accomplishment. No direct research on the impact of EAW on rates of burnout was located in our review of the literature. Burnout, though experienced at varying rates in employees, can have adverse physical and mental consequences including increased illness, withdrawal, and job dissatisfaction (Alarcon, 2011) as well as adverse professional outcomes such as turnover (Abraham, 1999).
After Wisconsin passed the “Budget Repair Bill” there was a significant spike in public employee retirements (Jordan and Battaglio Jr., 2014). This spike was seen by some as positive, as they saw the increased retirements as an example of underperforming employees moving on so higher performing employees could move up in their respective organizations. Others however saw the retirements as a negative outcome of EAW, as the state lost institutional knowledge as experienced employees left public employment.

### EAW’s Effect on Employee Complaints and Motivation

Rubin and Kellough (2011) first looked at the impact of civil service reform on employee perceptions of procedural justice and employee complaints. The authors found that agencies who had undergone reform had lower rates of complaints as compared to agencies with more traditional human resources structure. 

Recent research has found the implementation of EAW has significant negative impact on the motivation of public employees, particularly minority employees. (Battaglio, Jr., 2010). In the five-years after Georgia’s adoption of EAW, research found that employee attitudes were significantly and  negatively impacted (Battaglio Jr. and Condrey, 2006) with employees reporting increased pessimism, discontent, and frustration with the reforms. This negative perception of reforms was not only found in front-line employees. Managers and agency heads in Georgia reported similar frustrations, telling the authors (Battaglio and Condrey, 2006) they were “aghast” to learn Governing magazine had named Georgia’s human resources management as the “best in the country” (Barrett, Greene, Patton and Keeling, 2005).

## Ethics Case Study: The 'Nevada Four'

When the “Nevada Four” (O’Leary, 2014, p. 27-41) chose to work outside the formal bureaucratic structures of the Department of the Interior and the Nevada Department of Wildlife, they did so ethically. While the group chose to engage in many violations of their organization’s rules, their decision can be examined using an accepted method of ethical inquiry. Using Stone’s framework for testing when a breach of ethics is acceptable (2009), we see the Nevada Four were justified in their long-term effort to protect Nevada’s wetlands. Stone uses three tests to determine if rule breaking is ethical: whether there is personal benefit, whether the rule breaking is simply the easy way out of a difficult situation, and whether the rule violation serves a greater cause of justice.

The Nevada Four did not personally benefit from their decision, and in fact risked their own personal and family stability and employment. All members of the group reported there were professional repercussions, and some almost lost their careers, only to be saved by further ethical resistance and pressure from allies on senior bureaucrats. None of the members appear to have gained any financial advantage, and actually lost income due to their failure to advance within the organization. The Nevada Four pass the second test easily: they routinely chose the decisions which were not the easy way, and they did so over a period of many years. The easy decision would have been to simply comply with what they saw as immoral and unjustifiable decisions which threatened an important environmental resource. They persisted in the face of administrative consequence, when the easy way would have been to disengage. The final test, whether their decisions served the interest of greater justice, hinges on whether their goal of saving an environmental resource can be construed as a justice interest. Importantly, this test rests within the individual, and all four members of the Nevada Four reported that protecting the wetlands was the right thing to do. Further, they all lived in the area, had the scientific credentials to make the judgement, and one even reported a spiritual connection to the area. On balance, all four clearly believed their decision to resist was in the interest of greater justice. Therefore, using Stone’s framework, their decision to resist was done ethically.

### A Different Look

The Nevada Four may have had the best of intentions, but their actions were unethical, as they undermined the explicit expectations of our representative democracy. First, when they accepted a position within their respective organizations, they were accepting that their identity and personal moral beliefs were to be subordinate to the government’s, short of clear illegality. While on a micro-level anyone might admire their commitment to their little corner of the world, when we allow for individual bureaucrats to supplant official political decisions with their own best judgement, we risk a nation where our well intentioned human impulses can reign awful consequence upon the public. Should we simply accept that a police officer, who “knows” a serious criminal is going to hurt someone eventually, but doesn’t have probable cause for the arrest, to manufacture evidence? Would we allow a group of four immigration inspectors to impose their own truly held belief that certain religious beliefs are not compatible with American values, in lieu of the politically approved guidelines for entry? In admiring the ends of the Nevada Four, we risk ignoring the consequences of their moral resistance to the ethical demands of government work. 

The second major fault within the Nevada Four’s actions is the loss of trust by politicians in the career service bureaucracy. Sure, the Nevada Four attained their goal, but none of the politicians and appointed leadership went away, and they likely felt the sting of betrayal. The Stillwater Sanctuary is comprised of only 24,000 acres; midsized fires wipe out far more acreage every day, and on average we lose 1.5 million acres every single year, with 2.46 million acres lost in the first six months of 2017 (National Fire Interagency Information, 2017). This is all to say – Stillwater is a small backwater. The agency heads who are in charge of balancing the needs of vast, interdependent systems and ecologies need to be able to trust that their high-level political decisions will be enacted with fidelity at the career-service levels of the organization. In violating that trust, the Nevada Four have likely cost the other dedicated career service employees throughout the US and its territories the ability to engage openly with top leadership. To be trusted, one must first be trustworthy, and the Nevada Four decided their issue trumped the needs of all other employees who may have even more ecologically important areas to protect.  

### Going Forward

Government employees have an ethical duty to comply with the rules of their organization, an obligation that can conflict with their ethical duty to break those rules which threaten the organization or its mission. The Nevada Four faced this exact dilemma, and on balance I feel their decision was ethically sound. First and foremost, the Nevada Four were right on the issues, a finding underlined by the passage of the Fallon Paiute Shoshone Indian Water Rights Settlement Act in 1990, which gave legal protection to the Stillwater area as sought by the Nevada Four. In passing the bill, the legislative branch effectively granted the people’s political approval for the Nevada Four’s actions, and the President signed the bill, granting the pinnacle of bureaucratic approbation. These acts affirmed the Nevada Four had successfully protected both mission and organization.

Secondly, and in opposition to my own argument in the “con” section above, Stillwater matters. A person’s decision can only be made from where they stand. The agents of the Nevada Four were not in charge of the United States and its territories, they lived and worked in the Stillwater area. “A moral agent, in short, is only responsible for problems he can do something about” (Bowman & West, 2015, p. 78). The Nevada Four cannot be faulted for failing to sacrifice their 24,000 acres in the name of organizational efficiency, and in fact had they done so they would have been ethically deficient. In a vast representative democracy like ours, no single American can possibly hold all competing interest in their minds at once. It is in the synthesis of political directive, agency rulemaking, and the strained voices of the most concerned advocates that we somehow muddle through. While being objectively right in the end isn’t a necessary ethical test, it doesn’t hurt either. Some rules were broken, some egos pierced, but in the end, they did not physically harm anyone nor anyplace, and in doing so upheld their mission and acted conscionably. Whether through application of academic ethical framework or common-sense gut check, the Nevada Four were justified in their actions.

## Externalities & Non-Profits

In response to a question like that below:

> Why are the concepts of “externalities” and the “nondistribution requirement” so important for understanding the roles and functions of the nonprofit sector in the U.S.? In other words, what questions about the sector do these concepts help answer? For each, give an example or two of types of questions that they do not help answer.

Externalities are often unintended side-effects, or consequences, of an activity, the costs of which are not reflected in the cost of the activity. As an economic concept, externalities help explain why nonprofit organizations exist in the first place, due to market failures in addressing the externality. An example of a negative externality is air pollution. As the Salt Lake valley grew rapidly in the last few decades, industrial and vehicle pollutants produced vast amounts of air pollution. This pollution negatively affected the health of residents, but continued to grow year after year. The business sector was unwilling to address the issue, as the “market” was not providing a profit to motivate private companies to act, and government sectors were too bogged down with pluralistic interests to act convincingly. Into this gap sprung nonprofit organizations, which could operate without a profit motive unlike the business sector, and able to act along clear organizational goals without answering to “everyone,” unlike the governmental sector. Externalities also, at least in part, help explain the increasing professionalization of the nonprofit sector. Nonprofit organizations, founded in answer to market and governmental failures, must still conduct activities in the highly professionalized business and governing arenas if they are to be successful, and can achieve more when using the same “language,” education, dress, and cultural norms found in the other two sectors.

Externalities are considered a type of market failure, and have been a motivator for many nonprofits, but do not answer other important questions about the sector. Externalities do not provide a convincing answer for the longevity of certain nonprofit organizations, particularly religious organizations. Some churches represent among the longest-lived human structures (both literal and figurative), and do not appear primarily motivated by addressing externalities. Religious organizations, whether of the long-lived institutional variety or the evanescent neighborhood hall variety, appear to answer a different, more humanistic need, and do not fit neatly into an economic or market failure argument. Externalities also don’t answer how nonprofits continue to thrive in areas where the business sector is also being successful, such as health centers and hospitals. Many communities have a nonprofit driven community recreation center, often located geographically near several private gyms. Similarly, both nonprofit and for-profit hospitals continue to provide very similar services. While there are other economic and social models for understanding this phenomenon, “externalities” is not one of the satisfactory ones.

The “non-distribution requirement” is well-accepted as an essential trait of the US nonprofit sector, and is what “sharply divides” the nonprofit sector from the business sector (Frumkin, 2002). This concept is well-suited to explaining some aspects of the nonprofit sector, particularly those organizations which provide health related services and services to the poor. There is a gut-level feeling among many that organizations serving, for instance, mentally disabled adults should not be doing so in search of individual profit. Many donors would hesitate before giving money to such an organization if the potential donor knew the “company” would eventually be balancing profit against care. The concept of non-distribution is clearly one characteristic of the nonprofit sector, but cannot be seen as the defining characteristic. First, the concept doesn’t do enough on its own to differentiate between the government sector and nonprofits, because under that definition the State of Utah, the San Diego city council, and the US Department of Finance would all be considered “nonprofit” organizations. Second, the concept doesn’t explain the driving energy behind nonprofit organizations: voluntarism. Deemed the “coin of the realm” by Frumkin (2002), free, non-coerced, and voluntary participation is what “starkly differentiates the [nonprofit] sector from government, which can levy taxes, imprison violators of the law, and regulate behavior in myriad ways.” The non-distribution requirement is most useful in explaining why organizations exist in the nonprofit sector as opposed to the business sector, but is less useful in understanding how nonprofits differ from the governmental sector. 

## Charity & Non-Profits

In response to a question such as that below:

>Sociologist Nathan Glazer argues that the Unites States has become overly dependent on government for addressing community and individual problems; in his view nonprofit organizations are the key to reinvigorating community and individual responsibility, which will in turn produce salutary results for the American economy...By contrast, Robert Reich believes that the reliance of the United States on the ‘ideology of charity’ has produced inadequate, fragmented social programs because citizens in need of relief are not regarded as entitled to social benefits (Smith & Lipsky, 1993, p. 18). Who is right, Glazer or Reich? Defend your answer.Is there a middle-ground – is there room for a compromise – between these two views? Explain.

Glazer is more right than Reich, but both are merely representing realities of American history, and their individual places in it. Glazer’s argument is rooted in a Jeffersonian tradition of self-reliance and upward mobility, both still powerful motivators and with plenty of success stories to back them up. In his view, government entitlements tend to de-motivate individuals, eventually leading to less achievement. Starting in the 1930s, US government entitlements have grown from approximately two percent of GDP to 2015’s incredible 48.7%.  Glazer’s concern echoes Tocqueville’s original critique: “Everywhere the state acquires more and more direct control over the humblest members of the community and a more exclusive power of governing each of them in his smallest concern.” Glazer saw expanding state entitlement spending as expanding state control. His argument was not that the spending aid wasn’t needed, but that the spending should come from the nonprofit sector, where a pluralistic approach would allow for a maximal benefit to those in need, while minimizing risk of greater state control.

Reich, answering Glazer’s claims while Reich was Secretary of Labor under President Clinton (1993-1997), argues that through a unifying of services and aid under the umbrella of the federal government, society could more fairly address the needs of the poor and their communities. To his credit, from the lofty perches of the highest offices of federal government, it likely does appear that the demands of fairness and equity could only be answered through a large, uniform approach; and of course the largest, most uniform supplier is the US federal government. 

Unfortunately for Reich, his answer fails on two major points. First, he is not actually answering the critique of Glazer that a large federal spending response risks a large growth of federal control, with negative effects on individuals’ self-reliance and mobility. Second, by steadily moving towards federal government as the provider of first (and last) resort, Reichian policy fails to consider the benefits of the American tradition of pluralism. By allowing states to consider, enact, and reform policies in a pluralistic manner, Reichian policy prevents local solutions, targeted at local problems, from discovering better ways of addressing long-term problems. 	
Not only is there compromise available, it is likely inevitable. Just as Hamiltonian and Jeffersonian traditions have ebbed and flowed throughout American policy over several centuries, so too are the positions represented by Glazer and Reich more likely to end in a muddling middle rather than the poles.  Glazer began as a Trotskyist in the 1930s, broke with traditional liberalism by the end of the 1970s, and ended the 1990s with a book-length tormented reconsideration of many of his previous views (We Are All Multiculturalists Now, 1997). Though detractors may see him as ultimately uncommitted to any specific ideology, it is his willingness to fit ideology to reality that ends up a winning argument, closely mirroring the American history of evolving thought. As entitlements have now grown to represent nearly 50% of GDP, there will inevitably be a reckoning, a pullback, and a reborn intellectual interest in how to best support a tradition of American individualism, while still supporting those most in need. 


## Non-profits as 'mediating structures'

> Over the long haul, can nonprofit organizations be expected to live up to Berger and Neuhaus’ vision for them as “mediating structures” or buffers between individuals/families and large government/business organizations; or will funding needs and pressures eventually cause them to become mere extensions of these government/business organizations?

Churches and universities represent some of the longest-lived organizations in human history, and fit comfortably into the definitions of “mediating structures” as envisioned by Berger and Neuhaus; these organizations’ ability to survive modern needs and pressures should not be in doubt. Organizations such as the Catholic church (1st century AD to present) and Oxford University (1096 to present) have survived the worst political, economic, and military excesses of their times, and adapted to survive. Surely “funding needs and pressures” are unlikely to see these foundational “mediating structures” devalued to the point they are “mere extensions” of anything but the innate human needs the structures have evolved to meet.

The authors correctly identify the tendency for liberal states to construct large, impersonal, “abstract structures” in answer to nearly all societal problems. While some can be successful, the reality is that the “alienating effects” of these structures does little to answer the personal needs for fraternity, family, and spirituality that pervade humanity. For every large governmental institutional success, there is an individual cost. Often, paternalistic and authoritarian policy springs from good intentions to limit risk individuals, but there is always a commiserate cost to individual freedom; without risk there is little to gain.

Berger and Neuhaus’ theory is a middle ground, and is not usefully understood as an ideological pole. Only in the presence of alternative extreme views can the authors’ view be seen as anything but that of a rational middle. In evaluating policy prescription to address the need for affordable daycare, for example, the authors delineate the poles: that government should “stay out,” versus a “federally-funded, comprehensive child-care system attached to public schools.” The authors scratch out the rational middle-ground, as the need is real, and must be addressed. The best solution is found in mediating structures, as they address the need in an inexpensive and un-intrusive way. Innate human needs brought “mediating structures” to life, and just as they will not disappear simply due to new funding stressors, nor will the nonprofit organizations which serve those needs.

## Public Administration & War

To be used in the common “tell us about the development of public administration” – but this is an alternate view, and one that is very much ‘under development’ in that I’m tying together a bunch of loose, disconnected ends in other pieces.

### *Paravit in Bello*: How American Public Administration was Prepared by War

There are many possible stylized accounts of American Public Administration. In this essay I will trace a thread that in my education and reading is not often followed – the effect of war on the development of American public administration theory and practice. Pre-eminent theorists of public administration were shaped by war (and shaped) war. Wilson was the first to take public administration serious as a proper political science pursuit, and as president took the country into its first world war. Dwight Waldo reshaped his dissertation at Yale after serving as a civil servant in World War II. The resulting manuscript was published in 1948 as The Administrative State (Waldo, 2017). Many of the 44 men who have served as President were shaped by war. Twenty-six had military experience, at least six were soldiers by profession (Weaver, 2018). But not only presidents and philosophers have shaped public administration, and as I briefly trace throughout this essay, the strengthening of the administrative apparatus of the nation has often taken place at the hands of men who were shaped by war. The Latin phrase si vis pacem, para bellum is a time-tested warning that if you want peace, prepare for war. This essay will instead take on the task of roughing out an American public administration paravit in bello: Prepared by war. 

This essay proceeds in three parts. I begin with a sketch from the American Revolution through the second World War of how we might begin to think about the influence of war on the American administrative state. This section is not oriented towards scholarly detail, and is proposed as a brief alignment towards the idea that just as the political state was shaped by war, so must have been the administrative state. In the second section I sketch the influence of war on  America’s first believer in the need for strong public administration, Alexander Hamilton.  

### Presidents, Pragmatists, and Progressives: Briefly

The American Revolutionary War gave rise to its first spymaster and chief executive in George Washington. Following the American victory, the signal public agencies of the first decades of the new republic were administered by one of its genius war leaders, Alexander Hamilton (who deserves and receives more detail in the second part of this essay). The early 19th century expansion into the American west, and the accompanying growth in administrative agencies to oversee the new holdings, as overseen by a fiery, battle-tested war leader who preferred the title “General” to “President” (Somit, 1948). Their experiences as soldiers with the horrors of the American Civil War led a generation of pragmatic leaders to draw away from the religious and mystical, and closer to modern scientific ideals of law and administration (Menand, 2001). 

The United States entered World War I under the presidential leadership of Woodrow Wilson, who is also often recognized the first formal scholar of public administration. The bureau men of public administration embraced Progressive era ideals that were born in rejection of the atrocities of World War I, and further, an optimism that industry and science that would lead the country to a new golden administrative age (Stivers, 1995, 2002). Progressive reformers were informed by the pragmatists of an earlier decade such as John Dewey, who was distrustful of the absolute reason imposed by the Hegelian ideal of the state (Dewey, 1915), and especially its institutional form found in the Prussian and Germanic military states. As Spicer (2005) reminds us, there is a clear link between the Prussian military state and foundational public administrative thought – what Spicer deems the “purposive state”: a nation that turns its power, resources and citizens towards certain ends; as opposed to the state as a "civil association." Spicer succeeds in showing the influence of Prussian and German thinking on modern American administration through their influence on Woodrow Wilson and others. 

Dewey was wary of the militarism that he saw in Wilson and others, particularly a warlike mentality and nationalism he felt was ultimately destructive to his normative view of what the American state could be, arguing that (Dewey, 1915, p. 118)

>“…philosophical justification of war follows inevitably from a philosophy of history composed in nationalistic terms. History is the movement, the march of God on earth through time. . . . War is the signally visible occurrence of such a flight of the divine spirit in its onward movement. The idea that friendly intercourse among all the peoples of the earth is a legitimate aim of the human effort is the basic contradiction of such a philosophy.” 

Though Wilson expressed disquiet about Prussian state theory almost thirty years earlier (Wilson, 1887), he believed Americans could safeguard against the excesses, that we could borrow their methods of sharpening a knife without engaging in their murderous ends. Though foundational, Wilson’s propensity to engage in self-evident truths would be replaced by public administration scholars wary of easy answers based on clever metaphors (Ostrom, 2000; Simon, 1946). 

Dewey would fill in his own normative view of what the state should be in 1927 with The Public and Its Problems (Dewey & Rogers, 2012). The book laid out a modest vision compared to the purposive state (Spicer, 2005). The progressive state existed to act against and control the negative consequences of technology, and to harness the benefits with the instrumental goal of enhancing the lives of the public. Dewey’s account provided the foundation of Progressivism and the ‘good society’ (Lippman, 1937), and has been influential throughout American political thought, including Habermas’ pragmatist conceptions of technology, which promotes a mutually shaped science and politics in service of the practical needs of the citizenry (Habermas, 1970). It has also been argued that Dewey’s pragmatism set the guideposts for pragmatic, solutions-oriented Black American political thought after the civil-rights movement (Glaude, 2007). 

Pragmatism, in Dewey’s view, is an account of how people think – the way they form ideas and beliefs, and how those translate to decisions. This idea can be seen in the formative legal philosophy of US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, especially his conception of the ‘reasonable man’ (Mendelson, 1951). Holmes was scarred by his experiences in the Civil War (Menand, 2001), and pragmatism gave him the philosophical case for rejecting the metaphysics and transcendentalism that he saw as morally bankrupt following such destruction. Holmes’ jurisprudence relied on and synthesized the pragmatism of Emerson, Peirce, and Dewey (Menand, 2001; Mendenhall, 2015). Pragmatism focused on practicality and experience, and was soon adopted by the Progressive era reformers who sought to use that approach to highlight human progress.

Dewey was important to a great many areas of scholarship, including education scholarship, but for public administration we might consider his most immediate effect was on the pragmatic progressives depicted in Bureau Men, Settlement Women (Stivers, 2002). The book’s central theme is the establishment of the scientific-analytic and business-like public administration in the Progressive Era. Stivers sees there were two competing, gendered visions of public administration heading into the progressive era - women who were working with the people they were serving, and men who were attempting to professionalize and used the language of science to deflect political attacks on them as effeminate: “Long haired men and short haired women.” The ‘bureau men’ and their vision of a scientific approach to governance won out, but we lost out on the path of public administration that works closely with practitioners and those affected by our policy and research. 

That lost vision would eventually be redeemed somewhat in Dwight Waldo’s 1948 vision of the administrative state (2017), and echoes of it would be found in the largest modern expansion of the public administrative state. Roosevelt’s New Deal would eventually make good on Progressive promises, instituting the largest expansion of the American administrative state in history. Despite his Progressive alignment, he did not embrace the progressive ‘glass firewall’ theory that civil administrators could largely leave military matters to the military (Stever, 1999), or that war was anachronistic to the Great Society (Lippman, 1937, p. 159). War support became somewhat of a litmus test within Progressive circles, and even Dewey’s status was called into question after he voiced support for US entry into World War II. 

As an early supporter of Wilson’s presidential bid, Roosevelt was repaid for his loyalty with an appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I. As Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt instituted civil reforms of the Navy including merit-based promotions, and his reforms extended civilian control of the military broadly (Smith, 2007, see pp. 102–106). His experience there also exposed him to the difficulties in managing the relationships between union workers and public agencies. He handled the difficulty well, and in his seven years in post not a single strike was called (Burns, 1956, p. 52). Now President Roosevelt would call on that military, and the combined American public apparatus, as he led the country into World War II. A leading hero of that war was soon turned into the pre-eminent exporter of American public administration as the Military Governor of post-war Japan, and his administrative style may have had a “more lasting impact on current world events than his military exploits” (Tehan, 2002, p. v).

At this point, there is at least a clear argument to be made that a “useable past” (Stivers, 1995, p. 522) is available to us to structure our understanding of American public administration. 

### Hamilton’s Public Administration

Hamilton echoes the sentiment of the Latin phrase that this essay takes its motivation (quoted by Green, 2019, p. 155) in his speech to the Constitutional Convention: “Unless your government is respectable, foreigners will invade your rights; and to maintain tranquility, it must be respectable – even to observe neutrality, you must have a strong government.” 

Richard Green (2019) devotes a chapter of his portrait of Hamilton’s vision of public administration to how Hamilton’s experience with war framed his views on military and foreign affairs. “Much of Hamilton’s life revolved around war or the threat of war” (Green, 2019, pp. 155–156), and those experiences gave birth to a fierce patriotism for the new American nation, and a deep desire to protect it. Hamilton’s early military career as an artillery officer caught the attention of General George Washington, who promoted Hamilton to his aide-de-camp. After the war, Hamilton was installed as Secretary of the Treasury. His successes in that post are the focus of Green’s work showing the deep influence Hamilton would have in founding a strong central public administration.

Hamilton saw that the young nation’s survival would require an intricate bonding of the commercial and military functions of the state. Critical to that bonding was a strong defensive military capability, and as Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton oversaw many of the first efforts in that domain. Green gives a sense of Hamilton’s influence and scope as he shaped American defensive capabilities in a variety of administrative contexts (Green, 2019, p. 156): 

>“…he attended to the organization and management of the Department of War, and through his management of the Customs Service and a fledgling Coast Guard, he oversaw the protection of harbors from French privateering as the French Revolution ensued. He also equipped militias and helped Washington lead in the successful effort to quell the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania in 1794. When war loomed with France in the late 1790s, he returned to the military as a major general, second-in-command to General Washington, serving also as inspector general of the Provisional Army until 1800. He laid extensive plans and lobbied hard for the establishment of the navy, for the outfitting of a small standing army, and for professional military academies in which to train military leaders and subordinate officers in matters ranging from broad military policy to the technology of warfare.”

As he discusses in Federalist essays 23-29 (Hamilton, Madison, & Jay, 2009), Hamilton believed a permanent military establishment would eventually become necessary to secure the republic. However, distrust of centralized federal power among Anti-Federalists was strong.

### Conclusion

At the close of David Mayhew’s (2002) takedown of the theory of American political realignments, he proposes three possible explanations for political scientists still interested in constructing large scale theories of political process. One of the possibilities he suggests is to re-engage with American bellicosity – our long history with war. I have aimed at making a similarly simple argument here: that war has influenced how public administration is theorized and practiced. Two predominant themes suggest themselves. First, an experience with war directly as a military actor, as in the cases of pragmatists horrified by the Civil War, or Alexander Hamilton in the Revolutionary War.

## Nationalism versus Patriotism – John H. Schaar

Patriotism is not nationalism, though they have become conflated. “Patriotism too often sounds like nationalism, patriotism’s bloody brother” writes John Schaar . Written in the closing days of the Vietnam War, Schaar’s words are not limited by the time in which he wrote, and seem pointedly aimed at an audience of today. Schaar bemoans the fact that thoughtful people have come to misunderstand patriotism: “The intellectuals are virtually required to repudiate it as a condition of class membership. The radical and dropout youth loath it.”

Patriotism comes from a family of words that help us understand its meaning: legacy, covenant, reverence, loyalty, nurture, roots, citizen, debt, gift, republic. Reverence in particular has strong definitional power, as reverence “defines life by its debts: one is what one owes, what one acknowledges as a rightful debt or obligation.” Patriots move through the world understanding they have been granted great gifts, “grateful to the people and places through which they come, and determined to defend the legacy against enemies and pass it unspoiled to those who will come after.” Unfortunately, “We are not taught to define our lives by our debts and legacies, but by our rights and opportunities.” 

Shaar’s definition of patriotism reconnects to a humanistic, natural one: “Patriotism means love of one’s homeplace, and of familiar things and scenes associated with the homeplace. In this sense, patriotism is one of the basic human sentiments.” He stops short of defining it as an innate feature of humanness, but instead a “proclivity produced by realities basic to human life.”

Land patriotism is the base example, but American’s are historically removed from this type. City patriotism is another type, though more artificial, but is also in decline. These have been replaced with covenanted patriotism, which bonds Americans together through political ideas and ideals.  In Shaar’s conception, President Abraham Lincoln embodies and articulates this ideal. In Lincoln’s words “This covenanted patriotism assigns America a teaching position among the nations, rather than a superiority over or a hostility toward them. This patriotism is compatible with the most generous humanism.”  

However, Lincoln’s ideal patriotism has given way in the face of rampant consumerism, and a giving way of the concept of public good to aggregation of particular goods. “Liberalism and capitalism corrupted the covenant, while racism denied it to large groups of the population.” 
Even corrupted, Schaar sees Lincoln’s conception of covenanted patriotism as the one available to us any longer, and “offers the noblest rationale for active citizenship (govt of, by, and for the people) resident in our tradition.”

However noble, covenanted patriotism is not our reality – nationalism is. “The moral thrust of patriotism…is inherently ambivalent. It simultaneously unites and divides, encourages both concord and discord.” This is not a unique feature of patriotism, but rather a commonality among human devotions. “Division and conflict are built into the dialectic of devotion.” Love, faith, and loyalty all have similar ambivalences.
With patriotism, then, the dark face turns away from strangers, and a preference for our country morphs into a belief that our way is not just a great way, but the best way, and then finally into the only way. Where patriotism is natural, nationalism is contrived and artificial. The rise of nationalism is due to the successes of liberalism in “breaking the bonds among men” and new bonds were needed to replace the old, broken links. Two myths replaced the broken bonds. First, he state, the “coldest of cold monsters” (Nietzsche), successfully set itself up at the “sole legitimate object of patriotic attachment, with results that have on the whole been disastrous.” The second myth is the cult of progress, which Schaar seemingly abandons mid-thought, or perhaps felt it was beyond the scope of this already too-long answer.

Nationalism is so prevalent in our lives that it is difficult to understand just how recent a phenomenon it is. Schaar points out that when George Washington used the phrase, “my country,” he was referring to his home state of Virginia, not the United States. His was more of the natural patriotism, found in his attachment to the land, and a city patriotism, though in this case the city-state of Virginia was his referent. As nations were successful in growing and centralizing power, in the UK, France, Sweden, Russia, and the United States for example, each nation produced a similarity of character across their populations. Where before a wide range of “American” attitudes and customs had existed, a difficult to define “American character” sprang to life, and was adopted throughout the republic. 

Schaar sees “the hot ideology” of nationalism ebbing a bit, particularly in Europe but in America as well, and is being replaced with a “cool logic of technology and rationalization.” He sees this as the most important political task of the patriot today. We must sever the connection between nationality and nationalism, and depoliticize it. He compares it to religion, which over time was also successfully pried from the grasp of the state. Schaar sees this task as an important goal of education, and wants to see fragmentation of power and education – “Everything possible should be done to dismantle educational bureaucracy and break the stranglehold of officialdom on education. Encourage nonpublic educational ventures; let a hundred flowers bloom.”

## Policy Paradox (Stone, 1997), Trump, & Environmental Policy

Observers across the political and partisan spectrums have noted that President Donald Trump’s presidency is extraordinarily contentious, even beyond the normally high-temperature politics of the modern presidency. Among the most contentious policy areas during the Trump presidency have been reinterpretations of environmental and conservation policies. Discussion of the Trump administration’s substantive environmental policy approaches will focus on the reinterpretation of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, reduction of the Bears Ears National Park, and relaxation of regulations on oil drilling in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. Each of the three policy areas addressed have at their core the long-term battle between environmental and conservation groups on one side, and economic and energy interests on the other, but all three also have their own unique dimensions which complicate the policy and create great controversy.

In contrast to almost every other policy area the Trump presidency has interest in, the administration’s “space directive” policy for increased human space exploration received almost no broad critical response. Why the lack of policy “heat” in the area might be is explored in the second section.
Finally, the paper concludes with a brief overview of insights which help understand the policy environment of the Trump presidency Deborah Stone’s Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making (1997).

### Migratory Bird Treaty Act 

In December, 2017, the Trump administration’s Department of the Interior issued memorandum M-37050, effectively announcing it would no longer enforce key provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 (MBTA). The move to reinterpret the MBTA is contentious for both symbolic and substantive reasons. Symbolically, the MBTA was one of the first environmental protection laws in the United States, and was passed after the extinction of several common birds. The act served as a model for other conservation acts, and helped solidify conservation as a hallmark of federal administration of natural and wildlife resources. Substantively, the MBTA has been successful in the intervening 100 years in providing legal structure for the protection of hundreds of species of birds. This year is the 100th anniversary of the MBTA, and to honor the contributions of the act, the Audubon Society named 2018 the “Year of the Bird,” and other important voices such as the National Geographic Society followed suit with magazine covers and events to celebrate the progress that has been made in protecting important bird species, including the Bald and Golden eagles.

Since the 1970’s the MBTA has been interpreted to “strictly prohibit the unregulated killing of birds” (Scarlett, et al., 2018).  For a century, the clear language of the MBTA is that (emphasis added) “it shall be unlawful to hunt, take, capture, or kill…by any means whatsoever…at any time or any manner…any migratory bird” has served to hold companies and individuals accountable for actions that result in bird death. In the past, when companies have even inadvertently killed birds protected under the act, such as eagles striking wind farms, or in oil spills that kill literally millions of birds. Under the new interpretation by the Department of the interior, so long as a company can reasonably claim that their purpose was something other than killing or capturing wildlife, then it would be impossible to hold the organization responsible for even grossly negligent actions.
Environmental and wildlife protection groups have vigorously protested the Trump administration’s reinterpretation of the MBTA’s key protection provisions. Whereas the language in the act appears straightforward to wildlife advocates, the Trump administration issued new guidance in December, 2017, indicating that the act is only violated when (emphasis added) “the actor [is] engaged in an activity the object of which was to render an animal subject to human control.” Advocacy groups have criticized the administration’s new language, with one group of former appointees to the Department of the Interior calling it an “ill conceived opinion” and a “contrived legal standard that creates a huge loophole in the MBTA, allowing companies to engage in activities that routinely kill migratory birds so long as they were not intending that their operations ‘render an animal subject to animal control’” (Scarlett, et al., 2018). This group of advocates appears to value a balanced approach to conservation, as the signees worked for both Democrat and Republican presidents between 1971 and 2017. 

The Audubon Society is perhaps the most publicly visible organization with a focus on birdlife, and is greatly concerned with the Trump administration’s policy change. The Audubon Society credits the MBTA with “saving numerous species from extinction, such as the Snowy Egret, Wood Duck, and Sandhill Crane, and millions, if not billions of other birds” (Audubon Society, 2018). 

On May 24, 2018, multiple groups concerned with bird protection, including the Audubon Society, the American Bird Conservancy, Center for Biological Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, National Wildlife Federation, and the Natural Resources Defense Counsel combined efforts to file a federal lawsuit against the Department of the Interior. The lawsuit alleges that as a result of the Trump administration’s move to reinterpret MBTA, “protections will apply only to activities that purposefully kill birds. Any ‘incidental’ take—no matter how inevitable or devastating the impact on birds—is now immune from enforcement under the law.” Given the slow nature of federal litigation, it is unlikely the lawsuit will prevent the administration from overlooking significant bird kill before the judicial system weighs in. 

### Bears Ears National Park 

No single environmental issue so clearly shows the policy schism between President Trump and his opponents than the administration’s decision to reduce the size of the Bears Ears National Monument by 85%. The decision to establish Bears Ears was taken very late in President Obama’s presidency in 2016, as he prepared to exit office. Obama’s unilateral decision to establish the monument was hailed by both environmental and tribal advocates, but was controversial among western state politicians and energy producer organizations, who expressed concern with perceived federal overreach, and dissatisfaction that their concerns were not taken into account. President Trump signaled early in his term that he was open to eliminating or reducing the Bears Ears monument, and in December, 2017, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced the Bears Ears monument would be reduced from 1.35 million acres to just 200,000 acres. 

The decision to reduce Bears Ears continues to be controversial for three main reasons – political, environmental, and legal. First, some see the policy decision as purely political, designed to undermine the accomplishment of President Obama. This view was bolstered by the simultaneous decision to also reduce the Grand-Escalante National Monument, also in Utah, which had been an accomplishment of President Clinton. By drastically cutting the size of the two monuments, both put in place by Democrat presidents, some saw an effort by Republican President Trump to politically erase his predecessors. Trump supporters, such as Utah Senator Mike Lee, argue against this perception, as he sees the unilateral moves by Obama and Clinton as exemplars of overreach by federal politicians into state lands. “[President Trump] has been sympathetic to the fact that we’ve been mistreated,” said Senator Lee, “and I’m grateful he is willing to correct it” (Turkewitz, 2017). While both President Obama and President Trump may disavow the political motivations that led them to their respective decisions to establish and reduce the Bears Ears National Monument, there are reasons to believe otherwise. President Obama established Bears Ears on December 28, 2016, with less than a month to go in his presidency, and knowing he would be replaced by a Republican president unlikely to take the same action. The timing of the decision was immediately attacked by Utah politicians, who had long favored establishing some protected lands in the same area, but without the same prohibitions on economic and energy development. Utah Governor Herbert stated he was “more than disappointed” and “deeply disturbed” by President Obama’s unilateral decision (Griffin, 2016). This exact concern from local politicians was highlighted by Secretary Zinke, stating via the press release that (Boxall, 2017), "For years, the people of Utah and other rural communities have voiced concern and opposition to some monument designations. But too often in recent history, exiting presidents make designations despite those concerns.”

The blend of environmental and cultural politics is the second primary reason the decision to shrink Bears Ears was, and remains, controversial. In his proclamation creating Bears Ears, President Obama (White House, 2016) explicitly invokes the Native American names for the land in the first sentence, describing the sight of “twin buttes so distinctive that in each of the native languages of the region their name is the same: Hoon'Naqvut, Shash Jáa, Kwiyagatu Nukavachi, Ansh An Lashokdiwe, or ‘Bears Ears,’” and noting “the land is profoundly sacred to many Native American tribes, including the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Navajo Nation, Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah Ouray, Hopi Nation, and Zuni Tribe.” 

For many on the pro-monument side, the cultural heritage of the indigenous tribal people in the area demands action to protect the lands, and “President Trump’s decision to shrink the boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument was a moral mistake” (McBrayer & Roberts-Cady, 2018). For others, the President’s proclamation noticeably fails to pay attention or tribute to any of the non-tribal peoples who inhabit the area. While the proclamation goes to great length to describe the ancestral, cultural, paleontological, and wildlife resources of the area, there is no mention at all of the lives of many locals who call the area home. These local voices felt their concerns weren’t heard by President Obama, and felt vindicated by President Trump’s decision to diminish the monument’s boundaries. San Juan County Commissioner Rebecca Benally summed up the local feeling when she wrote (Weber, 2017), “Thank you President Trump. Thank you for not being a typical politician and passing us over.” 

The third reason Trump’s reduction policy on Bears Ears is so controversial is legal in nature. Simply put, while presidents can create national monuments under authority granted to them under the 1906 Antiquities Act, the ability for any president to unilaterally reduce or remove national monuments has not been clearly tested in court. Presidents have only rarely exercised the power, and even then, the changes were fairly limited (Meyer, 2017) and the lack of legal clarity means that advocates on all sides of the issue do not know the legal ground they stand on. The move to reduce Bears Ears was immediately met by lawsuits by environmental groups to stop the Trump administration’s reduction. Some legal scholars argued that the lawsuit strategy was doomed to fail, as the ability for a president to undo a national monument was implicit in the ability of a president to create it in the first place. Todd Gaziano of the Pacific Legal Foundation and John Yoo of the University of Berkeley law school argued even prior to the decision to reduce the monuments that (2017), “Prior presidents acted unilaterally to create or vastly expand several national monuments. It's simply unrealistic to pretend that acts created by unilateral presidential decrees cannot be undone in the same manner.”

Others disagree, including conservationists, environmentalists, and California state Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who argues that while the president has unilateral authority to establish national monuments, only Congress has the authority to diminish their boundaries (Boxall, 2017). Attorney General Becerra (2017) writes that “Trump simply has no legal authority to question monument designations made by a predecessor under the Antiquities Act.” Though Becerra states the position as a matter of fact, he does not indicate the legal standard by which he came to that conclusion, leading Gaziano and Yoo (2017) to mock Becerra’s position as “magical legal thinking” and noting that Presidents Coolidge, Taft, Wilson, Truman, and Eisenhower all reduced national monuments without court challenge or reversal. 

### Arctic Wildlife Refuge 

The largest span of protected wilderness in the United States is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), composed of 19 million acres along the northern coast of Alaska. The US Congress created ANWR in 1980 through the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, and as part of that bill included language to defer a decision on the ability of energy companies to drill in a subsection of the refuge which totals 1.5 million acres. Ever since deferring that decision, a political fight has been waged between environmental groups and energy companies over that smaller subsection. In late 2017, Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski was successful in including language in the tax-reform bill which finally opened up ANWR to oil drilling. President Trump signed the bill, and specifically called attention to the ANWR provisions, stating (Cama, 2017), “We’re going to start drilling in ANWR, one of the largest oil reserves in the world, that for 40 years this country was unable to touch.”

Environmental groups were predictably upset with what could be viewed as a historic defeat. Protecting the area from oil and gas development has long been a core issue for the American environmental movement, an issue that until the Trump administration they had been successful in prevailing on. Conservationists have long maintained that energy exploration in the area threatens multiple species, including thousands of migratory birds, but have highlighted two in particular, the caribou and the polar bear (National Wildlife Refuge Association, 2018). Caribou migrate through the ANWR, and every spring calve their offspring there, making the land there particularly sensitive to continued protection of the animal. ANWR is also the only national conservation area in which polar bears, a species deemed “vulnerable” with a decreasing population, den overwinter, again raising the environmental stakes. The World Wildlife Foundation (2018) lists oil exploration as a critical threat to polar bears, with oil development risking reduced insulation, poisoning, disturbance, disruption of biological functions, danger to cubs, and habitat destruction all highly concerning.  

Like the Bears Ears controversy, the element of tribal rights advocacy is also involved in the ANWR energy development policy debate. However, whereas in Bears Ears the voices of Native Americans appear united behind the side for protecting the lands from development, in the ANWR debate there are indigenous voices on both sides. Matthew Rexford, tribal administrator for the Village of Kaktovik, argued for allowing oil drilling, and testified before Congress that (Shankman, 2017), "The oil and gas industry supports our communities by providing jobs, business opportunities and infrastructure investments, has built our schools, hospitals, and has moved our people away from third-world living conditions—we refuse to go backward in time." Presenting the opposing view is Robert Thompson, a resident of the only town within the refuge, worries that any (Shankman, 2017) “exploitation” could impact his ability to hunt. “We get most of our food from the land,” Thompson said, and added that he didn’t want to “live in an oil field.”

Given the long history of the battle over oil drilling in the ANWR, it is likely that even with Congress directing the Department of the Interior to finally open up pieces of the refuge to drilling, the fight will continue for many years to come. Environmentalists have already announced their intent to seek legal remedies to continue protecting ANWR from drilling, were there even to be companies interested in seeking to drill there, which none have publicly expressed interest in to date.

### Expanding NASA’s Space Program

There is no doubt that finding non-controversial, substantive policies in the Trump presidential era is difficult. While there are small proclamations and narrow fixes that don’t seem to have captured the ire of opponents, it is rare for a substantive Trumpian policy to escape high-temperature partisan politics. However, President Trump’s call for expansion of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) space exploration program has generally been met with bipartisan support.

In 2017 President Trump signed “Space Policy Directive 1” (NASA, 2017). While the directive leaves NASA’s topline budget unchanged, it substantially changed priorities for the agency by zeroing out funding for the International Space Station (ISS) by 2025, and restructuring those funds into an expanded human space exploration program, with the intent of landing on both the moon and Mars. “The directive I'm signing today will refocus America's space program on human exploration and discovery," said President Trump, “This time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint — we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars and perhaps someday to many worlds beyond." 
Despite some dissenting voices within the space industry, who complained that defunding the ISS will hamper any hoped-for expansion of human presence to the moon and beyond (Roberts, 2018), on the whole, response to the policy was incredibly muted when compared to other Trumpian initiatives. The reason for the silence of opposition is rooted in the deep American character of space exploration, combined with the non-partisan nature of space policy. Americans still deeply identify with the success of the moon landing, and the fact that the United States continues to lead the world in both public and private space exploration and science. This gives political opponents little motivation to put effort into attacking the program, an act which many Americans would find at least vaguely unpatriotic. 

With the exception of President Clinton, every president has availed himself of the boost that comes from tinkering with space policy. There are no political “losers” in such a policy, as the money isn’t being shifted from other programs outside the agency, and in general the success or failure of any such program is far in the future, past when the originating president may have to pay any political price for failure of the policy. 

### Insights from Policy Paradox (Stone, 1997)

Deborah Stone’s classic Policy Paradox (1997) offers students of American policy two important lessons for policy scholarship, which helped inform this paper. First is the lesson contained within the title of the book, “pardox,” a theme developed within the author’s preface. “Rationality is a narrow conception of how humans think and feel, and that we are often forced to entertain paradox,” Stone writes (p. xi). Most American policy reporting is presented with a thin veneer of rationality applied over it, which tempts most observers into vain attempts to explain the various sides of a policy through models of efficiency, or economics, or equality. But at a very basic level, the reality is that all policy positions rely on unstated beliefs, not facts, many of which will conflict with one another and with attempts to “prove” policy facts rationally. Even the idea that rationality and emotion (or belief) are two bifurcations of the mind is an old myth, perhaps one of the longest-lived ones. 

Put in motion by Descartes, the notion that reason lives separate from emotion persists strongly in both our everyday talk and our scientific conceptions, despite having been thoroughly undermined by Rye (1949), permanently made nonsensical by Damasio (2006), and finally (for me) destroyed by primatologist and neurobiologist Sapolsky (2017). And although Damasio’s work has been cited over 26,000 times (!) now, even now prominent policy writers insist that their conception of a policy is the “rational” one; that they have somehow risen above the fray of being human, and returned with facts unsullied by such things as fear, desire, or other human frailties. 

Stone underlines the necessity of owning up to the impossibility of examining policy and politics through a lens of objectivity. “I don’t believe there are objective tests of goodness, or rules ofr human behavior that can automatically produce the best,” Stone writes (p. xiii), but then offers an alternative vision: “But even though I don’t believe in an objective standard of equity…neither do I believe that all distributions are morally equivalent.” Stone does not run away from demanding that a policy analyst must put herself into the analysis, and that rather than pretending at an impossible objectivity, “the policy analyst or decision maker must bring his or her values into the picture.” 

This lesson was important to me in examining the issues in this paper. Like most, if not all Americans, I find it difficult to put aside a belief that we can persuade through facts. But as Stone quotes jurist Jerome Frank (p. 311), “facts are guesses.” I am a birder, and so President Trump’s decision to reinterpret the MBTA strikes me more closely than does the decision to open ANWR to oil drilling and exploration. And while I made an attempt to present some balance to the picture, invariably that MBTA section will read as more advocating a position against Trump’s policy than does the ANWR section. Unwinding reason and emotion is an impossible task. Yet, impossibility is not the end of the policy discussion, and there is much worth pursuing. “We must be open to seeing alternative points of view if we hope to persuade those who disagree,” Stone says, and it is this lesson that I think is the most enduring and helpful to me. 

The second lesson from Stone relevant here is her “eight challenges” (p. 40) found in chapter two. Stone uses a chocolate cake, and the impossibility of distributing it fairly in the eyes of all involved, to teach her policy students how it is “possible to have competing visions of an equitable distribution (p. 39). The different challenges to equity can be systematically though of in three dimensions: recipients, items, and process. Her theoretical framework becomes more complex, but these three, high-level dimensions are useful for me when I begin to examine the policy debates around any topic. When asking “why didn’t President Trump’s space exploration policy invoke the heated partisan response we are used to seeing?” I can use Stone’s three dimensions to arrive at a preliminary conception:

Q: Who are the recipients with a stake in the policy? A: Mostly NASA contractors, who will see a shift in priorities, but their contracts likely stay in place, as the policy outcomes will not be emplaced for some time, and even then, the universe of space contractors is small enough that most contractors are likely to simply gain new contracts.

Q: What is being distributed? A: Trump’s space exploration directive keeps intact overall NASA funding, only shifting program funding a bit, and even then the bigger change of defunding the space station is many years away, past the sunset of the senior management at the agency. No one is losing today.

Q: What is the process of distribution? A: No competition, lottery, or voting mechanism can be pointed at in process terms. There is no notion of “fairness” for some parties to gain traction on, as pointed to in the recipients and items questions above. Stone notes that (p. 52) “processes of distribution create or destroy things of value…apart from the things they explicitly value.” But in the case of Trump’s space policy, little of value is at stake. The decisions have a long-time before becoming reality (leaving time for subsequent presidents to alter or retract the policy, as seems likely given the popularity of new president’s changing NASA funding priorities), and the biggest “loser” will be by then a 40-year-old project that is likely to have been retired soon anyway. 

## The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 (also Stone, *Policy Paradox*)

The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), and the resulting establishment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC), was passed in 1978, following revelations that President Nixon had used domestic law enforcement resources to spy on his political opponents. FISA represented a grand policy bargain between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of US government, and both granted and restrained the powers of each. The purpose of the act was to prevent such illegal surveillance, while simultaneously creating a separate mechanism for foreign intelligence activities to retain their ability to surveil potential threats. Substantively construed as a piece of legislative reform, FISA now enters it’s 40th year as law, and far from being simply a piece of historical interest, has become the object of significant policy debate, particularly in the years since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. This essay begins with a review of the original formulation of FISA, the administrative organs it brought into being, and the political climate which birthed it. In the second section, I discuss the two primary amendments to the original act, first in 2001 by the Patriot Act, and again shortly after with the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. The third section covers the interest groups which both support and oppose aspects of FISA, both originally and in its amended forms. Finally, the essay concludes with theoretical framing from Deborah Stone’s (1997) Policy Paradox, which casts FISA in conflicting views of security and process. 

### The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978

The Fourth Amendment of the US constitution provides protection for Americans from unreasonable search and seizure at the hands of the government and its agents. Key to these protections is judicial review of search warrant applications, which are intended to insure that prior to governmental intrusion into the person, places, papers, and property of an American, a judge must review the reason, the probable cause, for why the proposed search is legally reasonable. However, the 1970s brought a host of (Mayer, 2002, p. 249) “sinister programs” which “embarrassed the nation.” While President Nixon’s use of domestic law enforcement resources to spy on his political opponents was at the forefront of these embarrassments, other missteps and outright violations by federal agencies through programs such as (Mayer, 2002, p. 249) “the FBI’S COINTELPRO, the NSA’S Shamrock and Minaret, and the CIA’s Chaos” contributed to the call for reform.
These concerns eventually led to the several US Senate committee investigations by Senators Sam Ervin and Frank Church. Somewhat ironically, given the concern for overly secretive governmental activity, following these investigations a series of closed-door legislative meetings eventually gave life to the original Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The original bill was sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy (MA) and had nine co-sponsors, including Utah’s Senator Jake Garn. The FISA bill was passed into law with the signature of President Jimmy Carter on October 25, 1978.

### Political Context of FISA (1978)

The original FISA law aimed to both solidify the protection of Americans from unwarranted surveillance and intrusion, while still allowing for the robust foreign counter-intelligence required to protect a country which was still engaged in an active “Cold War” with its Communist enemy states, primary the USSR. On the one hand, it was argued, to simply require foreign intelligence agencies to apply through traditional Fourth Amendment channels – that is, traditional judicial review – profoundly risked national security. On the other hand, to trust in the unmitigated and unreviewed judgment of foreign intelligence agents had already exposed innocent American’s to violations of their constitutional rights. When the Supreme Court of the United States was presented in 1972 with the opportunity to carve out a 4th amendment exception for domestic security in the United States v. United States District Court (also known as the Keith decision), their 8-0 upholding the warrant requirement was clear in Justice Lewis’ majority opinion: 

>“The price of lawful public dissent must not be a dread of subjection to an unchecked surveillance power. Nor must the fear of unauthorized official eavesdropping deter vigorous citizen dissent and discussion of Government action in private conversation. For private dissent, no less than open public discourse, is essential to our free society.”

While the Supreme Court was clearly placing limits on executive authority to surveil without a warrant, the Keith ruling failed to prescribe a comprehensive solution to the very real and conflicting demands of maintaining domestic order and yet leaving the privacy of Americans untrammeled. The answer lay in FISA’s establishment of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. 

### The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)

The FISC specifically, and FISA generally, represented a grand bargain between the all three branches of the federal government. The executive agreed to allow its surveillant powers to be curtailed and reviewed through a court established by Congressional act, and Congress allowed that judicial review to take place out of public view, in secret courts. The FISC itself was a new agency, a specialized court whose judges would be directly appointed by the Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court to staggered, seven-year terms, allowing for the appointment of one judge per year. In the event a warrant is denied by a FISC judge, the government may seek appeal to the entire FISC panel of judges, or to a panel of three sitting circuit judges (known as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, and has only held two sessions, in 2002 and 2008), or to the Supreme Court itself. Thus, all three branches were activated and engaged in the reform policy.

Under FISA rules  intelligence agencies may conduct warrantless operations without FISC approval, but only and exclusively against foreign targets, and only for up to one year (assuming Presidential authorization through his Attorney General). In the event the target of the surveillance is a US citizen, or the operation extends further than a year, or any other set of facts falling outside the relatively narrow scope of the classic FISA definitions, then a warrant for the surveillance operation must be sought through the FISC.

FISC judges hear only cases related to foreign surveillance. During their seven-year terms, they serve one week of every eleven, as demanded by law, in Washington D.C. (and there must always be at least three FISC judges within 20 miles of the capitol). FISC cases are heard ex parte, with only the government providing evidence and testimony – putting it quite outside the “normal” operation of other courts hearing warrant requests. Outside of the FISC, a judge can be relatively sure that the issuance of an ex parte warrant stands a credible chance of being challenged through eventual defense counsel. Foreign intelligence warrant applications, on the other hand, do not have that same assurance, as it is often unlikely (though not impossible) that foreign intelligence operations will result in criminal charges, particularly if the foreign agent is working on behalf of another nation’s own intelligence service. The focus of FISA is to “facilitate foreign intelligence investigations – and not criminal prosecutions,” (Vladeck, 2015, p. 1167) and this focus served to lessen resistance to the court using a relatively lower probable cause standard in deciding whether to issue the warrants applied for. 

Congress appeared to believe the creation of the specialized court was beneficial for two primary reasons: specialized knowledge and familiarity with the foreign intelligence concerns brought before it, and expediency. To the first, the court would (Vladeck, 2015, p. 1166) “be able to put claims of national security in better perspective” than would “judges who do not have occasion to deal” with the foreign surveillance issues considered under FISA. To the second, Congress placed specific geographic requirements for the judges, at least three of them at any time, to be quickly available in Washington DC, so that agents seeking time-sensitive warrants were able to quickly access a FISC magistrate. 

### “Classic” FISA and its Amendments

So far, this essay has only briefly covered FISA in its original form, sometimes referred to as “Classic FISA.” In reality, FISA was almost immediately met with calls from foreign intelligence agencies to update the law. In 1979, the first year after FISA became law, FISC judges heard 199 applications for surveillance, and issued 207 orders for foreign surveillance (Senate Report, 1980, p. 2). Despite what seemed a high success rate for surveillance applications, heads of agencies charges with foreign surveillance asked Congress for revisions to the “emergency surveillance” portions of the law, as they thought the 24-hour window in which such surveillance could be conducted sans warrant was too small, as NSA Director Inman testified that (Senate Report, 1980, p. 7) “we were not farsighted enough to recognize in the bureaucracy, with weekends and things like that, 24 hours is not very long for emergency; 48 would be better.” Director Stansfield of the CIA was less prosaic, noting in his testimony that "the 24-hour period is inadequate, leading to the necessity of delaying implementation of emergency surveillances."

Small amendments such as those found in the 1980 amendments (Senate Report, 1980) – extending the time frame of emergency surveillance, expanded definitions of agent of a foreign power, and whether US agents could make physical entry into the property of certain foreign state actors – were typical of FISA amendments for the first 24 years of it’s existence. Through the end of 2001, FISA was rarely the target of media interest, and the regulations settled quietly into the quiet, orderly existence of most federal regulation. However, that comfort was seriously upended with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 

### The USA Patriot Act of 2001

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act, hereafter “Patriot Act”) was passed into law less than two full months after terrorists flew two commercial airliners into the Twin Towers of New York City, killing 2,996 people, injuring over 6,000 more, and causing at least $10 billion dollars in direct infrastructure damage, between $40 an $70 billion dollars in insured damage, and even more (but inestimable) in uninsured loss (Cummins & Lewis, 2003).   While the Patriot Act of 2001 is a large comprehensive policy, here the discussion will be limited to the provisions contained within Title II of the act, entitled “Enhanced Surveillance Procedures.” 

Title II of the Patriot Act primarily amended FISA, and the substantive changes were unsurprisingly related to the phenomenon of non-state terrorist actors. Under the classic FISA definitions these actors were not subject to surveillance without warrant, as classic FISA was written in an age where the clandestine efforts of state actors were the primary concern of policy makers and intelligence services. In addition to expanding the definition to terrorist actors, the most controversial provision allowed for the collection of foreign intelligence information from those residing in the United States, both non-citizens and US citizens alike. Title II also gave expanded scope of searches to agencies, including so-called “sneak and peek” warrants, and “roving wiretaps,” both of which proved controversial. The Title II amendments also allow for any federal district court judge to issue surveillance orders, where as discussed earlier this was originally the sole jurisdictional purview of FISC judges.

### Protect America Act of 2007

President Bush’s “War on Terror” continued apace through 2007, as did the intelligence agencies work to protect the country from further attack. As the intelligence gathering techniques of the nations intelligence agencies continued to grow in sophistication, so did the counter-intelligence techniques of the foreign and terrorist targets of surveillance, and President Bush urged Congress to overhaul FISA in order to avoid restricting the ability of intelligence agencies to do their critical work. In 2007 Congress complied and passed the Protect America Act (PAA). While construed as an amendment, the PAA was in effect a complete overhaul of FISA, and allowed for even greater surveillance without warrant so long as it was it was directed at one or more persons reasonably believed to be outside the US. This had the effect of removing from FISC supervision much of the surveillance conducted by US agencies, as the acting agency had only to report through their own chain of command the reasonable belief that at least one of the surveillance targets resided outside the US. The PAA also compelled communication companies – internet service providers and cell phone companies included – to comply with administrative orders from the intelligence agencies, and in turn granted civil immunity to those providers acting under the color of the same. 

The “Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008” followed the PAA of 2007 with additional strengthening of the warrantless surveillance activities of the US intelligence services. Its provisions increased even further the window for “emergency” surveillance (complaints about this time window stretch back to the days immediately following original passage of FISA in 1978, see Director Ingram and Director Stansfield’s Senate testimony earlier), gave civil immunity to telecom providers who were compelled to provide information to requesting intelligence agencies, and finally added more ability for US agents to use emergency eavesdropping to gather foreign intelligence absent court supervision.

The final legislative activity related to FISA occurred in late 2017 and early 2018, as provisions of both the PAA and the amendments of 2008 were set to expire at the end of 2017. Despite a great deal of controversy surrounding government surveillance since the Patriot Act, and continuing in the sixteen years after, Congress was convinced by the intelligence community of the need for an extension of the provisions. On January 18, 2018, the Senate passed the “FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017,” and the next day the bill was signed into law by President Trump. The substantive effects of FISA and its amendments were thus extended for six years, through December 31, 2023.

### Critics and Supporters of FISA

As FISA exists in both its “classic” and “modern” forms (Vladeck, 2015), with its most controversial aspects enacted in the post-September 11, 2001 forms, this section will only briefly touch on the relatively uncontroversial nature of its original 1978 passage. As noted earlier, the political atmosphere in the 1970s was one where the passage of FISA was relatively uncontroversial given the nature of the surveillant intrusions by federal agencies, and by President Nixon himself. There was a clear sense, especially following the Keith decision by the US Supreme Court, that all three federal government branches had to come up with a structure which both reified the Fourth amendment protections for Americans, while simultaneously allowing the intelligence agencies to protect against foreign intelligence operations without undue interference. The negotiations which led to FISA were closed-door affairs, as Senators consulted with intelligence agency heads to construct a lasting solution. Given the secretive nature of those negotiations, controversy was relatively muted. For the most part, the original crafters succeeded in their aims, and the FISA bill of 1978 survived in its original form through the rest of the century.

In the tension and fear which followed the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Patriot Act passed without much controversy. However, in 2005, with the publication by the New York Times (Risen & Lichtblau, 2005) of details of warrantless surveillance by the NSA on Americans, FISA became a highly visible policy, with the expected resultant criticism. The New York Times article revealed that at any given time, up to 500 Americans were surveillance targets, and that the surveillance was ofttimes conducted without a warrant, under the relaxed constraints granted by the Patriot Act. The most common criticism, leveled by organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Broadly, these organizations remain committed to the ideals of a 4th amendment unsullied by considerations of national security – that is, that they seek to “meaningfully reform our broad surveillance authorities” (ACLU, et al., 2017). One such reform that is popular outside just the activist community is the creation of a “special advocate” (Vladeck, 2014) within the existing FISC structure. Such an advocate would (Vladeck, 2015, p. 1176) “appear opposite of the government in at least some cases before the FISC and to argue on behalf of the public, those whose communications are being targeted by the government application at issue, or some combination of the two.” The special advocate would, theoretically, be able to contest the governments case for surveillance, introducing the ability for the FISC judge to consider more than just the government’s assertions.  Some critics of the surveillance powers of the US, including Glen Greenwald, have tied those historical concerns to their portrayal of President Trump as unstable, and likely to abuse the powers of FISA. Given those concerns, Greenwald (2018), in his typically restrained prose, argued that “The same Democrats who denounce Donald Trump as a lawless, treasonous authoritarian just voted to give him vast warrantless spying powers.” 

On the whole, those in favor of continuing the paradigm of FISA tend to have had the stronger voices, at least in the legislative forums which make decisions related to FISA. Even politicians who are aligned strongly against the current presidential administration, including Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, supported the extension of the FISA amendments in the 2017 bill. Many have endorsed the broad FISA regime as emblematic of the potential for good policy to protect both privacy interests and national security, due to how carefully controlled it is (Goldsmith & Hennesy, 2018, pp. 5), and even privacy proponents and critics of President Trump:

>“…have a high degree of confidence that the National Security Agency and the U.S. intelligence community more broadly cannot and will not abuse the 702 tool even if they harbor concerns that Trump might desire to do so. They know that 702 is deeply embedded in a reticulate legal system run mostly by career public servants and supervised by all three branches of government, including numerous agencies in the executive branch, the congressional intelligence committees and the life-tenured members of the FISA court. In short, the answer to Greenwald’s puzzle about Trump critics voting for 702 reauthorization is that the NSA and FBI are remarkably immune from inappropriate presidential meddling.”

With the extension of FISA and its modern amendments through the last day 2023, there does not appear to be any realistic threat to its viability as the ruling policy on foreign surveillance in the United States. 

### FISA Through Stone’s *Policy Paradox*

Deborah Stone’s (1997) formulation of legal rights in the polis offers a useful scaffolding for working through the complex balance of securities inherent in discussion of FISA. Rights are not solid objects, they require interpretation, and in the US system that interpretation takes place in the legal system. The “myth of legal rights” holds that all are equal before the law (Stone, 1997, p. 344), and rights are tested and enforced in a unbiased legal system, where defendants are able to meet the government on equal ground, where the best argument between equals wins the day. But of course, in the system of FISA, none of this is exactly true. 

FISA laid the administrative structure for FISC, and has the trappings of a neutral, unbiased court, with the appointment of magistrates who (theoretically) are able to hold the government accountable by denying agent’s application for surveillance warrants. However, it is important to take into account the actual process in FISC courts. They are held in camera, without the benefit of the public eye to correct oversteps or collusion. The hearings are by their nature ex parte, and only rarely are defendants ever notified through criminal hearings, let alone given the opportunity to confront the government and test the probable cause of the surveillance warrants. 

Stone differentiates between the identities of parties, “one-shotters” and “repeat players,” in the legal system. One-shotters enter the legal system once, or at least rarely, and are focused on the tangible outcome of the legal case rather than establishment of favorable rulings to govern future cases. Repeat players, on the other hand, are frequently litigants, and are much more likely to have great legal resources to engage in protracted, strategic legal battles. In battles between one-shotters and repeat players, the “parties are not equal before the law” (Stone, 1997, p. 346) and the repeat players are likely to dominate through their resource advantage. Further, they hold the balance of bargaining power, and are more likely to fight to the end rather than bargain in order to force the court to “produce a rule change as well as a tangible remedy” (Stone, 1997, p. 346). Stone’s formulation here is both helpful in examining the FISC system, as well as somewhat blind to the realities of the specialized courts found under FISA, and her conclusions don’t go far enough to adequately describe the power imbalance. It is useful to the extent that in FISC hearings, the government has virtually unlimited resources, and can engage in ongoing, repeated attempts to attain the result they want. 

However, the extreme imbalance wrought by FISC hearings held both in camera and ex parte results in legal imbalances so large that Stone’s concepts don’t envision them at all. The defendants in FISC hearings are not truly one-shotters – they are “no-shotters” who never appear before FISC judges, nor rarely even criminal court judges. And yet, simultaneously, the government and the judge are not only repeat players, they are repeat players with each other, as the universe of intelligence agencies, their intelligence lawyers and agents, and the eleven FISC judges is quite small indeed. This results in the same judges making decisions about warrant applications made by the same agents, over and over. While it is hard to imagine any of these legal players anything but the most professional, ethical, and high-minded individuals the civil service has to offer, they are human, and humans are social creatures prone to the mistakes of social creatures. Asking that none of those players take on beliefs about the other based on their previous interactions is to ask them to set aside their humanness. A FISC judge, who has seen forty superb surveillance applications from the same Department of Justice lawyer representing the FBI can be imagined to have developed some sense that she can trust the probable cause representations of that lawyer. 

Stone’s theoretical approach to rights led to my support for the idea of an independent “special advocate” to act as an additional check upon the government’s case during FISC applications. The concept of a “devil’s advocate” stretches back to ancient times, with the position filled at the Vatican by a senior Cardinal, who, though he remained loyal to the Pope and Council, was also bound to challenge decisions by both to the best of the advocate’s ability, even in those tiems where the advocate personally would have endorsed the decision. Similarly, in the FISC system, a special advocate would be charged with providing the best challenge he could to the government’s case. Properly designed, such a position would strengthen both the government’s case in the event of later challenge, but also the public perception that decisions by the FISC court were undertaken in the best spirit possible. This, in turn, would strengthen the ability of the FISA laws themselves to protect the privacy of Americans which provided the impetus for the law’s original passage in 1978.

## Public Administration: Traditions & Roots 

As a discipline, public administration is a study in unresolved, and unresolvable, tensions. The term “public administration” itself is hard to define perfectly: Is it the professional practice of running public and non-profit services, or the academic study of that work that seeks to (Marini, 2000, p. 3) “understand, develop, criticize, and improve that professional practice as well as train individuals for that professional practice”? Does running government differ from running a business? How intertwined are politics and administration? How intertwined should they be? As we confront the difficult tradeoffs in public policy, should we pay more attention to facts, or values? 

This essay will review the traditions of  primarily academic public administration, though its practitioners make appearances as well – like attempts to divide politics from public administration, attempting to describe American public administration through only its theorists is a doomed effort. John Rohr (1986) laid out three ‘foundings’ he saw as important milestones in American public administration: the founding of the Republic (1787-1795); the founding of modern modes of public administration (1883-1889); and the founding of the administrative state (1933-1941). For the most part I will follow those signposts in the early sections of the essay, though I extend into the modern era as well as the essay presses into the influence of Herbert Simon and the future of public administration. 

The essay proceeds as follows. In the first section I review the co-founding of America with the founding of the first public administration norms of George Washington and administrative structures of Alexander Hamilton. In the second section the essay recounts the foundation of academic public administration through the works of Wilson, Taylor, Gulick, and Barnard. In the third section the foundation of American pragmatism is shattered as Wilson leads the US into World War I, giving rise to a progressive movement that embraced an overlooked influence on public administration, John Dewey. This section concludes with the New Deal, a vast expansion of the administrative state through the leadership of Roosevelt

### The Founding
The dilemmas and tensions that the field of public administration is concerned with today are to a great degree the same that have been of concern from the moment of the nation’s founding. The Constitution set forth the tenets and framework that the nation’s Founders believed gave the nation a coherent way of addressing those dilemmas. George Washington, and Alexander Hamilton provide two institutionalized views of how to run a constitution: A system that holds service to the public as its first principle, and a blended economic, commercial, and military union that could prevail in the storm of state-based interests that would confront the nation. 

George Washington was America’s first president, and the nation’s first executive administrator. Without binding precedent to guide him, Washington’s actions would themselves become the guide for all that followed. Key among his challenges was the creation of the tools to run the constitution, a challenge that for many public administration scholars remains the highest calling for the field. Washington was well aware that as first president, his actions would reverberate throughout the nation’s future history. As such, he believed the foundation of his actions needed to be firmly set in principle. As he wrote to James Madison (quoted in Cook & Klay, 2015, p. 76), “As the first of everything, in our situation, will serve to establish a Precedent, it is devoutly wished on my part, that these precedents be fixed on true principles.” 
Among his first actions was establishing a public administration, and the “true principle” Washington tied it to was the public wishes and affection. In other words, public administration should rest upon service of the public will. In his 1791 address to Congress, Washington tied the establishment of the direction of the nation’s public administration directly to the public will (Cook & Klay, 2015, p. 77):

>“It is desirable on all occasions, to unite with a steady and firm adherence to constitutional and necessary Act of Government, the fullest evidence of a disposition, as far as may be practicable, to consult the wishes of every part of the community, and to lay the foundations of the public administration in the affection of the people.”

The constitution did not directly provide for a public administration, and Washington was to sketch out the institutional foundations that were necessary to run a constitution. In the centennial year of the Constitution, Woodrow Wilson, known as the first scholar of public administration, would highlight the challenge (W. Wilson, 1887): “It is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one.” 

The rough sketch of how to establish a public administration may have been penciled in by George Washington, but it was the hand of Alexander Hamilton that inked in depth and detail. Like Washington, Hamilton was a hero of the Revolutionary War, and he would establish and administer the signal public agencies of the first decades of the new republic (Green, 2019). Much of Hamilton’s approach to public administration is not found in the Constitution he helped create, but in the Federalist papers (Hamilton, Madison, & Jay, 2009) that defended the Constitution to a nation distrustful of a new Federal nation. Hamilton was responsible for authoring approximately 50 of the Federalist Papers, and he saw that the government could not solely be about checking power among the three branches, it would also have to enable action. Hamilton’s concept of ‘partial agency’ meant that powers should be blended among the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, such that the three institutions would collaborate to address the problems of the nation. 

His Federalist co-conspirator James Madison was a patrician elite who was focused on keeping the federated states civil especially in regards to interstate trade, but it was Hamilton who saw that the federal government should seek that civility explicitly through the development of a complex economic union. To accomplish that vision, Hamilton spent a great deal of his time enhacing executive power. Hamilton saw that the young nation’s survival would require an intricate bonding of the commercial and military functions of the state. Critical to that bonding was a strong defensive military capability, and as Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton oversaw many of the first efforts in that domain. Green gives a sense of Hamilton’s influence and scope as he shaped American defensive capabilities in a variety of administrative contexts (Green, 2019, p. 156): 

>“…he attended to the organization and management of the Department of War, and through his management of the Customs Service and a fledgling Coast Guard, he oversaw the protection of harbors from French privateering as the French Revolution ensued. He also equipped militias and helped Washington lead in the successful effort to quell the Whiskey Rebellion in western Pennsylvania in 1794. When war loomed with France in the late 1790s, he returned to the military as a major general, second-in-command to General Washington, serving also as inspector general of the Provisional Army until 1800. He laid extensive plans and lobbied hard for the establishment of the navy, for the outfitting of a small standing army, and for professional military academies in which to train military leaders and subordinate officers in matters ranging from broad military policy to the technology of warfare.”

As he discusses in Federalist essays 23-29 (Hamilton et al., 2009), Hamilton believed a permanent military establishment would eventually become necessary to secure the republic. However, distrust of centralized federal power among Anti-Federalists was strong and able to prevent the establishment of a fulltime federal military until after the Civil War. 

We should not underestimate Hamilton’s impact on public administration based on whether an institution was or was not established, because it is his vision that so strongly permeates how we think about public administration even today. The controversies Hamilton confronted were often left unresolved, and persist today. Hamilton was born to the lower class, and knew what it meant to be treated like a second-class citizen. Hamilton suggested that indigenous and Black Americans should be treated as citizens (though he famously did not include women in his progressive vision). Of course, even today America has not resolved its racial or gender inequality. Hamilton sought social revolution through commercial and economic revolution. His successes come to us today as unresolved questions on public versus business administration. Perhaps the most lasting unresolved controversy is Hamilton’s view that there was no politics and policy dichotomy: “Administration and policy merged seamlessly in his mind, each conditioning the other” (Green, 2019).

### Founding of Academic Public Administration

The founding of the American nation and its first administrative scaffolding was successful. A system of addressing the controversies resulted in regularized processes of administrative law. The Constitution’s framers "created a certain ambivalence in the status and direction of American public administration" (O’Toole, 1987).  The Constitution embedded the concept of separation of powers the American consciousness, and so it should be no surprise that as the administrative state was founded, there were efforts to imbue a similar balance by dividing politics and policy. 

The Pendleton Act, also known as the Civil Service Act of 1883, is an example of attempts to divide politics from administration (Theriault, 2003). The act aimed to insulate the bureaucracy from political influence, and "even more obviously represented an effort to enact the dichotomy" (O’Toole, 1987). Before Wilson introduced his own dichotomy to public administration  there were efforts to legislatively do the same to the practice of administration, such as the Budget and Accounting Act of 1821 - "probably the greatest landmark of our administrative history except for the Constitution itself" (Emmerich, 1971). Similarly, the Hatch Act of 1939 legislated the dichotomy even further by prohibiting federal employees (and some state and local by 1940 amendment) from participating in most partisan political activities.

Public administration scholars have generally been hostile to the principles of separation of powers(Waldo, 2017). The field itself was founded in a Wilsonian tradition that held up the separation of politics and administration. While we have moved away from that dichotomy, have we really confronted what our field tends to do - calling for greater and greater executive powers? We are a field of the executive branch, and many of our prescriptions are overtly hostile to the legislative process and for an expansion of the executive branch.

The first century of the nation established a public administration apparatus, but it took that century before any scholarly attempt to study it began. Woodrow Wilson was the first to do so in 1887. Though much later he would become president himself, at the time he was interested in government and how to best understand how a government should organize its efforts. In his article “Study of Administration” (W. Wilson, 1887), he argued that the complexity of government meant that the best was to study it was from two perspectives: the politics found in the legislative function, and the public administration found in the executive functions of government. This gave birth to a politics and policy dichotomy that would dominate our academic understanding of public administration until late in the 20th century. Though Wilson acknowledged that the two areas of government were intertwined, his contribution of the dichotomy was a convenience to simplify the study of it. Wilson argued that the politics of governing could best be understood when it was intentionally isolated from the administration of political decisions. In this early Wilsonian view, decisions about ‘who gets what, when, and how’ (Lasswell, 1936) are best understood by studying the political and legislative (who gets what, when), separate from the executive actions to complete politics decisions (how). Wilson sought to scientifically uncover the principles that would enable public officials to run the Constitution, by establishing the study of public administration as a field of study separate from politics. 

Classic public administration scholarship was dominated by this kind of thinking, exemplified in Frederick Taylor’s (1914) ‘scientific management, and Luther Gulick’s (1937)acronym POSDCORB: (planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and budgeting).  Neither of these outlooks on public administration are completely unuseful or unused, even today. Taylor was an engineer interested in applying the scientific method towards management, and finding the one best way to organize human effort. He scientific management as putting greater demands on "management" and easing the work of the worker. Taylor advocated a scientific approach, to move the knowledge contained in workman's heads onto paper where it could be studied, and best practices extracted and then propagated to other systems. In his view,  this would lead to very little conflict between workmen and management. 

Gulick attempted to move beyond Taylor's scientific management, with an effort to more logically divide work. Gulick proposed there are limits to division of work, and that proper coordination among the divisions of labor are necessary: If subdivision is necessary, so is coordination of that work. Gulick was an early positivist who believed empirical research would be necessary to understand a range of questions, including the proper "span of control," or how many laborers a manager could be expected to manage well. He did not approve of multiple command, but rather urged unity of command. Finally, he was not a technocrat and did not trust "experts" to stay within their own field: "experts on tap, not on top." Organization must be approached from both bottom-up and top-down perspectives. Gulick combined his insights into a theory of the proper executive: A chief executive’s job is "PODSCORB" planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, budgeting. 

### Pragmatism, War, and Progressivism

The United States entered World War I under the presidential leadership of Woodrow Wilson, who is also often recognized the first formal scholar of public administration (Wilson, 1887). The bureau men of public administration embraced Progressive era ideals that were born in rejection of the atrocities of World War I, and further, an optimism that industry and science that would lead the country to a new golden administrative age (Stivers, 1995, 2002). Progressive reformers were informed by the pragmatists of an earlier decade such as John Dewey, who was distrustful of the absolute reason imposed by the Hegelian ideal of the state (Dewey, 1915), and especially its institutional form found in the Prussian and Germanic military states. As Spicer (2005) reminds us, there is a clear link between the Prussian military state and foundational public administrative thought – what Spicer deems the “purposive state”: a nation that turns its power, resources and citizens towards certain ends; as opposed to the state as a "civil association." Spicer succeeds in showing the influence of Prussian and German thinking on modern American administration through their influence on Woodrow Wilson and others. 

Dewey was wary of the militarism that he saw in Wilson and others, particularly a warlike mentality and nationalism he felt was ultimately destructive to his normative view of what the American state could be, arguing that (Dewey, 1915, p. 118)
“…philosophical justification of war follows inevitably from a philosophy of history composed in nationalistic terms. History is the movement, the march of God on earth through time. . . . War is the signally visible occurrence of such a flight of the divine spirit in its onward movement. The idea that friendly intercourse among all the peoples of the earth is a legitimate aim of the human effort is the basic contradiction of such a philosophy.” 

Though Wilson expressed disquiet about Prussian state theory almost thirty years earlier (W. Wilson, 1887), he believed Americans could safeguard against the excesses, that we could borrow effective methods of sharpening a knife without engaging in the same murderous ends. Though foundational, Wilson’s propensity to engage in self-evident truths would be replaced by public administration scholars wary of easy answers based on clever metaphors (Elinor Ostrom, 2000; Simon, 1946). 

Dewey would fill in his own normative view of what the state should be in 1927 with The Public and Its Problems (Dewey & Rogers, 2012). The book laid out a modest vision compared to the purposive state (Spicer, 2005). The progressive state existed to act against and control the negative consequences of technology, and to harness the benefits with the instrumental goal of enhancing the lives of the public. Dewey’s account provided the foundation of Progressivism and the ‘good society’ (Lippman, 1937), and has been influential throughout American political thought, including Habermas’ pragmatist conceptions of technology, which promotes a mutually shaped science and politics in service of the practical needs of the citizenry (Habermas, 1970). It has also been argued that Dewey’s pragmatism set the guideposts for pragmatic, solutions-oriented Black American political thought after the civil-rights movement (Glaude, 2007). 

Pragmatism, in Dewey’s view, is an account of how people think – the way they form ideas and beliefs, and how those translate to decisions. This idea can be seen in the formative legal philosophy of US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, especially his conception of the ‘reasonable man’ (Mendelson, 1951). Holmes was scarred by his experiences in the Civil War (Menand, 2001), and pragmatism gave him the philosophical case for rejecting the metaphysics and transcendentalism that he saw as morally bankrupt following such destruction. Holmes’ jurisprudence relied on and synthesized the pragmatism of Emerson, Peirce, and Dewey (Menand, 2001; Mendenhall, 2015). Pragmatism focused on practicality and experience, and was soon adopted by the Progressive era reformers who sought to use that approach to highlight human progress.
Dewey was important to a great many areas of scholarship, including education scholarship, but for public administration we might consider his most immediate effect was on the pragmatic progressives depicted in Bureau Men, Settlement Women (Stivers, 2002). The book’s central theme is the establishment of the scientific-analytic and business-like public administration in the Progressive Era. Stivers sees there were two competing, gendered visions of public administration heading into the progressive era - women who were working with the people they were serving, and men who were attempting to professionalize and used the language of science to deflect political attacks on them as effeminate: “Long haired men and short haired women.” The ‘bureau men’ and their vision of a scientific approach to governance won out, but we lost out on the path of public administration that works closely with practitioners and those affected by our policy and research. 

That lost vision would eventually be redeemed somewhat in Dwight Waldo’s 1948 vision of the administrative state (2017), and echoes of it would be found in the largest modern expansion of the public administrative state. Roosevelt’s New Deal would eventually make good on Progressive promises, instituting the largest expansion of the American administrative state in history. Despite his Progressive alignment, he did not embrace the progressive ‘glass firewall’ theory that civil administrators could largely leave military matters to the military (Stever, 1999), or that war was anachronistic to the Great Society (Lippman, 1937, p. 159). War support became somewhat of a litmus test within Progressive circles, and even Dewey’s status was called into question after he voiced support for US entry into World War II. 

As an early supporter of Wilson’s presidential bid, Roosevelt was repaid for his loyalty with an appointment as Assistant Secretary of the Navy during World War I. As Assistant Secretary of the Navy Roosevelt instituted civil reforms of the Navy including merit-based promotions, and his reforms extended civilian control of the military broadly (Smith, 2007, see pp. 102–106). His experience there also exposed him to the difficulties in managing the relationships between union workers and public agencies. He handled the difficulty well, and in his seven years in post not a single strike was called (Burns, 1956, p. 52). Now President Roosevelt would call on that military, and the combined American public apparatus, as he led the country into World War II, an feat dubbed “administrative mass organization” that relied heavily on the scientism and technocratic abilities established by Taylor a generation earlier (Kasza, 1995). Following the Allied victory, a leading hero of that war was turned into the pre-eminent exporter of American public administration as the Military Governor of post-war Japan, and his administrative style may have had a “more lasting impact on current world events than his military exploits” (Tehan, 2002, p. v).

### Behavioralism and Beyond

The end of World War II brought about the end of orthodox (or classical) public administration, and the beginning of behavioral, empirical public administration (Marini, 2000). The behavioralist bent was not unique to public administration scholarship, and was sweeping across the social sciences broadly. In public administration, the behavioralist turn was simultaneously taking place alongside a hew humanistic, values-oriented approach. This essay will explore the most visible debate between those two views later in recounting the Simon/Waldo debates (Simon, Drucker, & Waldo, 1952). First, however, I trace  how the bureaucratic approach was converted or an organizational one.

The post-WWII period brought a new energy to the study of public administration and efforts to diversify its theoretical and empirical study. Gulick’s (1937) bureaucratic approach covered earlier is still alive and well in the practice of public administration, even as its academic study leaves the acronym behind as too simplistic. Even in Gulick’s day other scholars thought his prescription was unrealistic, and too unfocused on the people that make organizations work. Charles Barnard (1938) recognized the importance of individuals, and that organizations cannot be well understood without understanding people. While Gulick focused on the formal lines of command, familiar to us today as “org charts,” Barnard highlighted the importance of informal organizations. Informal organizations are based on personal rather than joint purposes, and promote uniform states of mind by crystallizing mores and customs. Barnard set out several ways informal and formal organizations are interdependent:  Informal organizations give rise to formal organizations; formal organizations are necessary to any large informal organization; formal organizations make explicit the states of mind developed within the informal organizations; formal organizations in turn also create new informal organizations. Finally, informal orgs are necessary to formal organizations as means of communication, cohesion, and of protecting integrity of the individual. 

A sociologist at Columbia University, Robert Merton (1939) stressed how the study of bureaucracy misses the importance of personalities within the bureaucratic structure. Merton saw how bureaucracies infuse the employees with certain rules in order to maximize efficiency, but these rules become the end, instead of a means to the end (i.e. red tape). Merton called on other social scientists to begin studying public administration. Many soon did, and relied on a Maslow’s hierarchy of needs as a basis for understanding human motivation in organizations. Also at Columbia University, Maslow (1943) described a basic structure of human needs, arranged in hierarchies of prepotency: Basic needs, safety needs, love needs, and self-actualization. Though not substantiated empirically, Maslow’s hierarchy proved crucial to the beginnings of motivational and human-focused theories in the study of administration.

#### Human Centered Approaches

The human focus for some public administration scholars can be seen in MacGregor (1960) and his ‘Theory X’ and ‘Theory Y” approach to motivating employees. Most of public administration had been based on expectations that employees would shirk their responsibilities and therefore needed close supervision and clear punishments to keep them in line. MacGregor saw that another approach based on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs (Maslow, 1943) was better suited to the evolving workplace. In this ‘Theory Y,’ MacGregor advocated that the individual worker is creative and driven, and a good manager encourages employees to problem-solve on their own, gives them the tools to do so, and then gets out of the way. Theory Y is “management by objectives” rather than the “carrot and stick” management of Theory X, and MacGregor saw this as the necessary adjustment to an evolving workforce that expected more out of work than mindless micromanagement: “This is a process primarily of creating opportunities, releasing potential, removing obstacles, encouraging growth, providing guidance.” In MacGregor’s view, this was not leadership for public managers, but management for both public and private agencies. 

#### Divorcing Public from Private, Proverbs from Positivism

The application of business principles to public administration practice was a taken-for-granted “good” in public administration, and even today there are consistent efforts to imbue government with the magical efficiency of public markets. One early effort to separate public and private management was made in the book Government is Different (Appleby, 1945). Three aspects differentiate running a government versus a business. First, government has a vastly expanded scope and impact. Second, government is publicly accountable to everyone, not just a small pool of shareh0lders. Third, the political character of public administration means that government must take into account the will and wishes of the people, a factor that recounts Washington’s founding principle of public administration. Appleby saw that government, in its people, attitude, and function, is different than any other activity, including business. He was especially critical of those who would come from the business world and expect government to be a good fit for them: "Only a politician can be president." Government is different because government is politics, and while businesses are able to carefully select their market, ‘government’ has no clearly delineated border: "Statecraft - government - is different than all other professions because it is broader than anything else in the field of action." 

As late as 1955, with the publication of the first public administration textbook, business and public administration were still seen as somewhat synonymous, and the textbook called for a public administration that is more than “the time-honored approach of ‘muddling through’” (White, 1955). Public administration was seen as the great problem of government, and like the original call for more exacting study (W. Wilson, 1887), White (1955) suggested that American democracy could learn better administration techniques from the autocrats in Europe. There was growing focus on the longest-lived organizations, churches and universities (Downs, 1967), and Europe was home to the oldest of both (at least to the Western-centric scholars of public administration at the time). 

Even as Downs theorized the lifecycle of bureaus resulted in highly conservative institutions, however, the landscape of American public administration was shifting. Civil service unions were gaining power as their membership grew massively at both the federal and state level (Mosher, 1968). Bureaucrats were no longer the ‘heroes’ of the progressive era and a new, negative connotation was taking hold. The unending cycle of reform in American public administration (Kaufman, 1969) was due to the uniqueness of the American experience, especially the constitutional nature of power separation that led to a succession of shifts in focus on three core values: representativeness, politically neutral competence, and executive leadership. Kaufman argued from a pluralist perspective, and saw that none of the three was ever truly absent from the American consciousness, but the focus changed. And as the focus changed, pressure from groups interested in the other two brought pressure and calls for more reform. Kaufman saw the calls for decentralization of government power in his time as the result of racial and youth power groups who felt under represented in the current regime. The constant reform was not a negative, however, as Kaufman wrote that “wheels turning on their own axes still advance.” 

### Simon and Waldo Debates

The most critical inflection point in the modern study of public administration came from Herbert Simon. Simon was an organizational theorist who urged scholars to think carefully about what a methodology of  public administration should be (Simon, 1946): How do we acquire scientific or empirical knowledge about public organizations? Weber's (1946, 2015) ideal bureaucracy does not exist in the real world, so how can we compare and contrast the types of bureaucracy in a scientific sense? Herbert’s wide-ranging critique of the study of administration was born from the positivist and post-positivist debates (Popper, 1959) that sought to replace the verifiability claims of empiricists with a demand for falsifiability. Herbert likened what came before to "proverbs, not science…Armchair philosophizing about administration...has gone about as far as it can profitably go in this particular direction." Herbert provided the push to turn the study of public administration towards positivist science.

Dwight Waldo disagreed with Simon’s positivist prescription for the direction of public administration scholarship going forward, and the two engaged in an exchange of ideas in the pages of the American Journal of Political Science. The Simon-Waldo debate was structured on two differing philosophical perspectives that continue to define the study of public administration today (Harmon, 1989). The debate was quite ugly, and a full understanding of the importance of the debate only became clearer with the passage of time, and as Herbert’s unique genius became even more noticed with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 (March, 1978). However, two decades earlier the first punch in defining debate in public administration scholarship began with the fortieth footnote in Waldo’s essay “Development of Theory of Democratic Administration.” Waldo maintains that to follow arguments for efficiency in administration to their logical ends is to engage in ‘nihilism,’ and then while he emphasizes the need for democratic values in making administrative decisions, he manages to slight Simon’s accomplishments as being unscientific  (Waldo, 1952, p. 97):

> “In this contention, the present ‘weight of authority’ is against me. But I believe that there is no realm of ‘factual decisions’ from which values are excluded. To decide is to choose between alternatives; to choose between alternatives is to introduce values. Herbert Simon has patently made outstanding contributions to administrative study. These contributions have been made, however, when he has worked free of the methodology he has asserted.”

Until this point, Waldo and Simon had been complimentary of one another, and both attacked the naïve scientism that had dominated the study of administration to that point. However, beginning with Waldo’s salvo, it was clear that two competing visions had emerged. On the one hand, Simon drew analytic distinctions between facts and values, and then another distinction between administration and policy. On the opposing hand, Waldo insisted that administration and policy were both impossible to separate from normative values (Harmon, 1989, p. 440): “Waldo’s project was, after all, to warn of the limits of science in human – and, in particular, administrative affairs, while Simon’s was to inform us of its power.” Where Herbert sought efficiency, Waldo asked “efficiency for whom?”

Many a barrel of ink has been spilled evaluating the Simon/Waldo debates, and it is outside the scope of this essay to cover the differences in full, nor is it particularly helpful to understand either Simon or Waldo’s philosophical orientation to public administration through a handful of their papers in the early 1950’s. Some of the draw of this debate is no more than the dramatic counter-punching and name-calling that took place. For instance, consider this exchange opened by Simon in his first reply to Waldo, (Simon et al., 1952, p. 495):

> “Quite apart from whether Mr. Waldo’s premises are right or wrong, I do not see how we can progress in political philosophy if we continue to think and write in the loose, literary, metaphorical style that he and most other political theorists adopt. The standard of unrigor that is tolerated in political theory would not receive a passing grade in the elementary course in logic, Aristothelian or symbolic.”

Waldo does not back down from his literary, metaphorical style in responding (Waldo, 1952, p. 501): 

> "Professor Simon charges me with profaning the sacred places of Logical Positivism, and I am afraid I have. I use this figure of speech because Professor Simon seems to be that rare individual in our secular age, a man of deep faith. His convictions are monolithic and massive. His toleration of heresy and sin is nil. The Road to Salvation is straight, narrow, one-way, and privately-owned. We must humbly confess our sins, accept the Word, be washed pure in the Blood of Carnap and Ayer. Then, he says, we will no longer be ‘enemies.’”

I do not mean to suggest the two did not engage with the substantive issues that had brought them to loggerheads in the first place. However, the visceral, pointed debates were more fun to watch because of the high personal stakes each was willing to bring to bear in defense of their philosophical orientations. This was not a removed, dry, and academic debate most were used to in the low-stakes scholarly pages of American Journal of Political Science. 

A stylistic dichotomy has persisted in how we think about the Simon/Waldo debate, however, and that difference is that Simon has come to represent the unrepentant logical positivist, while Waldo plays the foil as the artistic, normative, and value-concerned philosopher. Neither caricature is true – but both are helpful in understanding the men’s  influence on the ensuing development of public administration scholarship into a ‘post-normal’ field of inquiry (Riccucci, 2010). 

### The New Public (Administration, Management, Governance) 

The logical positivism of Simon and the values orientation of Waldo have been replicated in contemporary conflicts between the two main theoretical orientations of scholars: New Public Management (NPM) and New Public Governance (NPG). Simon’s scientific, efficiency-centered outlook underpinned the rise of NPM to a dominant approach by the 1980s, while Waldo’s vision is seen in NPG, which “makes value conflicts a legitimate function of administrative work” Morgan & Shinn, 2014, p. 9). 

The traditional views of public administration put forth before the 1970s elevated increased efficiency, economy, and coordination as its primary goals. In his essay "Towards a New Public Administration," Frederickson (1971) added social equity (defined as activities designed to enhance the political power and economic well-being of disadvantaged minorities) to the mix. Frederickson was providing an overview of the 1968 Minnowbrook Conference, a gathering of public administration scholars in which Dwight Waldo played an important role. Minnowbrook attendees sought to define the normative orientation for public administration scholarship by focusing on equity (Frederickson, 1971): "Simply put, new Public administration seeks to change those policies and structures that systematically inhibit social equity." In a departure from the logical positivism of Simon, New Public Administration did not elevate neutrality as a value: public administrators "should be committed to both good management and social equity as values.” The New Public Administration (NPA) framework would return with a fuller theory of public administration eventually in New Public Governance (Morgan & Cook, 2015; Osborne, 2006), but at the time its most apparent contribution was to add equity to the traditional formula of efficiency, effective, and economic management of public agencies. 

Between Minnowbrook’s innovation and its eventual translation to the New Public Governance (NPG) came an intervening acronymic regime of public administration: New Public Management (NPM) (Hood, 1991).  Though similar in acronym to New Public Administration, its goals and emphases are quite different. NPM attempted to once again inject the responsive, customer centric management perspective found in business management into public administration. To do so, NPM applied business management techniques such as a focus on customer satisfaction, performance measurement, and competition into the public sector. The approach first emerged in New Zealand, but soon found willing practitioners in the United Kingdom and the United States (S. H. Mastracci, Adams, & Kang, 2019). 

Though the critiques of the approach are manifest and will become evident momentarily, NPM was successful in some areas. The focus on measures of efficiency and effectiveness gave public managers and street-level employees (Lipsky, 1983) the capacity to use their expertise to diagnose and correct operational problems (Ammons & Rivenbark, 2008). NPM also emphasized performance management, and the resulting visibility of performance data broadly increased interest in systems of accountability in government (Pandey & Moynihan, 2006; Wholey & Hatry, 1992), as well as the role of selection and motivation of public employees to improve organizational performance (Moynihan & Pandey, 2007). Finally, the emphasis on systems of performance management expanded the array of values that were considered important in public administration to include cost, efficiency, outputs, outcomes, impacts, satisfaction, responsiveness, and quality of life (Morgan & Shinn, 2015). 

However, though NPM saw some successes, it can not overcome two fundamental problems. First is that there is no common denominator that can be applied in a cross-cultural context, and so there is no common basis for comparison. Relatedly, even the modest expansion of values that can be measured pales in comparison to the values available and important to the study of public administration: “fairness, equity, protection of rights, and transparency play important roles in determining the legitimacy of political institutions, processes, and outcomes” (Morgan & Shinn, 2015, p. 4). The second shortcoming of NPM is its over-reliance on models of business administration to structure the governance of public institutions. Consider just the American example of public administration, with overlapping spheres of authority and influence at the federal level, to say nothing of the balkanized state and local government, reliance on non-profit entities, and contractual relationships between public and private sectors (Morgan, Green, Shinn, & Robinson, 2013, pp. 115–118).

These critical flaws in classic administration were not overcome by NPM, which in turn led to the founding of NPG. As the failures of NPM became apparent, scholars noted a new approach was needed, one that “acknowledges the existence and likely persisitence of ‘third-party government” and that brings “the new tools of public action that are now in widespread use to the center of public and professional attention” (Elliott & Salamon, 2002, p. 8). From that call was born NPG, which begins with acknowledging the pluralist nature of the state (Dahl, 1982), and sees that to manage such a state demands acknowledging the co-production of values among the participants in that state. Co-production in turn leads to value conflicts, and it is the role of public administration to mange those value conflicts. 

The second main advantage of NPG over NPM is in the former’s focus on an engaged citizenry, enabling the efficiency found in co-production. NPG moves well beyond the limited, dichotomous view of public versus private sectors in the classical public administration to a networked, holistic concept of public and private and non-profit (Pestoff, Brandsen, & Verschuere, 2013). This integrates the polycentric theories of the Ostroms’ work (E. Ostrom, 1982; 2011; V. Ostrom, 1987). The polycentric concept was originated in studies that looked at conflicting studies of municipal police departments (Parks et al., 1981), which could not parse why small city police departments had less costs, while they enjoyed more trust and satisfaction from the residents they served when compared to large police agencies. Theory at the time predicted that the efficiencies of large metropolitan police agencies should improve trust and satisfaction among residents. The answer was found in what was deemed “co-production” of public safety (Parks & Ostrom, 1999). In smaller jurisdictions, residents knew their public safety officials and felt safe reporting suspicious activity and crimes to a degree that residents of large metropolitan areas did not. The close relationship between public and private actors co-produced public safety, and accordingly the costs of public safety were less in smaller jurisdictions. This model of co-production was soon modeled in areas of local governance other than public safety (Michael D. McGinnis & Ostrom, 2012). Co-production is a core value of NPG, and means that successful public managers are able to interact with a public that is citizen, customer, and partner (Thomas, 2013). 

### The Post-Normal, Algorithmic Future of Public Administration

Looking back on the first century-and-a-half of the formal study of American public administration, one can easily see how the field has consistently been drawn to consistent dichotomies. Wilson saw it as a division between policy and politics. Simon and Waldo drew distinctions between science and values. New Public Management sought the adoption of private market theories into the management of the public weal. New Public Governance reinvigorated public management with a call to blend public and private. The seduction of epistemic communities continues to drive much of current scholarship as well, as sub-communities of the public administration field hew close to their preferred traditions and methods of uncovering T/truth (Riccucci, 2010). These divisions can undermine how the field advances, as “academic sectarianism produces less understanding rather than more…Epistemologically, we should recognize there are multiple valid and perhaps even complementary paths to understanding” (Lake, 2011, p. 465). Norma Riccucci (2010) suggests answer dogmatism lies in recognizing that the applied nature of public administration means it operates outside the paradigmatic strictures of Kuhn (1970, 1974): maintaining some semblance of methodological pragmatism, matching method to research question, and triangulating on answers with multiple methods.  

One of the areas that public administration scholars will be critical to is the effect of big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in public governance. The voice represented by public administration scholarship is necessary to surface the realities confronted by the practitioners confronted with overseeing the intersection of the public sector and big data, machine learning, and other technologies. There is no doubt that scholarship needs to be multidisciplinary – international power, regime studies, war theory, genocide, administrative evil, and ethics, every field of scholarship will be impacted. These theoretical visions begin though with adoption of big data technology and machine learning at the municipal level – an adoption that is already occurring (Coglianese & Lehr, 2016, 2018). Machine learning and big data are already used in criminal sentencing, policing strategies, and identification of lethality in domestic violence (Adams, 2019; Ferguson, 2017), among others, all of which fits squarely within traditional domains of public administration scholarship. Public administration offers the natural voice to help guide the ethical considerations and responses to the inhuman, or at least non-human, politics of the future (Agarwal, 2018; Battaglio & Hall, 2018). 

Sara Jordan frames the public-sector impact implicit in a shift towards big data (2014, p. 276): “How ought government protect the public against the use of their data but also protect the public through the use of their data?” If public administration scholars do not direct their energy and interests towards investing the human mind into questions of how big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence interact with governing, it risks becoming outmoded and irrelevant. Public administration is well situated to offer solutions to these questions, however, due to its strengths in multiple methodological and ontological approaches in the field (Riccucci, 2010). 

In their recent review of literature investigating big data and the public sector, Cecilia Fredriksson and her coauthors reveal the complexity and importance of big data, and the critical importance of scholarship (2017, p. 47): “Governments are central to both creating and managing knowledge”. Gary King, director of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science at Harvard University, is clear in his assessment of the changes that big data and artificial intelligence promise  (Lohr, 2012, p. 1): “It’s a revolution. We’re really just getting underway. But the march of quantification, made possible by enormous new sources of data, will sweep through academia, business, and government.” And as political scientists have noted, revolutions tend to have some bloodletting, at least metaphorically, as scientific revolutions look a lot like political revolutions (Farr, 1995). Public administration, concerned with both government and governance, theory and practice, should not consider itself safe from the big data revolution; no matter ones’ preferred ‘isms’ (Lake, 2011), it seems an unlikely outcome. Recall, however, King’s assertion of the underlying questions being quantitative ones. Even allowing for rhetorical excess, as large as his claims are, they are not encompassing enough. It is a mistake to see “big data,” which is essentially a descriptor of quantitative information, as having only quantitative implications. Recent advances have made sophisticated quantitative analysis of even very large text corpora a manageable task (S. M. Mourtgos & Adams, 2019b; Roberts, Stewart, & Tingley, 2014).

A metaphor can be drawn to other historically recent revolutions. If a scholar were to posit that neither the industrial nor internet revolutions were particularly impactful to how public administration is performed and studied, would any reader take them seriously? The industrial revolution, with massive gains to efficiency, was not limited to “only” affecting industry – political, governance, and ethical implications followed. Even the very recent internet revolution, just a few decades old, has wrought social changes in the rise of populism (Bruce Bimber, 1998; Chadwick & Howard, 2009), among countless other consequences to governing. While a comprehensive review of the changes to polities brought by the industrial and internet revolutions is outside the scope of this paper, it is also unnecessary, if one accepts the simple premise that a similarly situated revolution is underway in the move towards big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. These shifts in turn bring shifts in political priorities, in class struggles, in institutions. It is this insight which underlines the need for public administration scholarship to bring its varied methodological tools to bear on the issues, as well as look for every opportunity to engage with other disciplines.

The questions about big data stretch beyond mere quantification, and Sarah Jordan (2014, p. 375) sees the value of public administration’s methodological plurality: “The future of public administration lies in its ethical knowledge work and expertise.” The ethical implications of government use of information technology is “one sketchily researched area” deserving more scholarship (Menzel, 2015, p. 363). Some work is beginning to appear, with research papers and publications in legal journals beginning to address the role of machine learning in administrative agencies (Coglianese & Lehr, 2016), questions about algorithmic ethics and fairness (Ferguson, 2017; Friedler et al., 2019; Joseph, Kearns, Morgenstern, & Roth, 2016), and emerging legal definitions of ‘personhood’ among artificial entities (Karanasiou & Pinotsis, 2017). However, these questions, which are necessarily multi-disciplinary, and despite having the potential for grave impact on the public sector (Battaglio & Hall, 2018; Fredriksson et al., 2017), so far lack the input from public administration scholars that would leverage the strength of our focus on merging the theoretical insights of political science with the realities of practice (Guy, 2003). 

Within the next several decades, deep learning neural networks and artificial intelligence will begin to replace two of the four pillars of what Keohane (2009) identifies as the core functions of political science: descriptive inference and causal inference. Retooling public administration through old ontological debates will not answer the question faced by political scientists in the coming years: what are we for? To reframe Rogers Smith (2015, pp. 366–367): perhaps public administration is not so exceptional, and is not alone in facing profound change in how scholarship will be done. Does public administration see itself so different in scope and complexity that it can escape what other human-centered fields have already begun to cede core functions to? If machinated intelligence comes to dominate descriptive and causal inference, what public administration scholars should get better at is the puzzling (Keohane, 2009, p. 360) – observing what does not fit with theory – and conceptualizing, particularly as it relates to translating scholarly arcana to ordinary usage. We must become better data scientists and qualitative researchers and puzzlers and conceptualizers – all at once. Alongside those, society will be in need of intense scholarly focus on instilling our ethical knowledge work into the machine learning, neural networks, and artificial intelligences that are the future of both governance, and the study of governance. 

### Conclusion

In celebration of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, John Adams wrote John Whitney to decline an invited appearance. In his letter, John Adams (1826) warns how things can still go wrong in a United States that is (emphasis in original) “destined in future history to form the brightest or blackest page, according to the use and abuse of those political institutions by which they shall in time come to be shaped by the human mind.” Adams appears prescient nearly 200 years later, in a society increasingly shaped by big data and machine learning, with artificial intelligence on the horizon. Innovative solutions in the coming decades will involve putting aside the ontological debates of the first century in public administration scholarship (Riccucci, 2010), and leveraging the multiple methodological and ontological traditions of the field to address what are likely to be revolutions in both how government uses data, and how data influences government. The public administration scholar twenty years hence will be charged with inserting the ethical, the human, and the workable into models derived by machinated intelligence; or, put another way, in resolving the cerebra of Simon by inserting the viscus of Waldo, in reuniting the “two cultures” (Snow, 1963).

Though he is the godfather of the science of artificial intelligence, Herbert Simon is not robotic. At least by the end of his life, Simon writes both about the ‘beautiful’ and ‘true’ – the wonderful and the comprehensible – merging humanity and science. While early Simon works emphasized the quantitative and measurable, he grew to see the ontological divisions as somewhat of an artificial distinction, and both he and Waldo fought against what can be seen now as a naïve scientism. Bounded rationality was not a line drawn in concrete, beyond which stood the incomprehensible, but one drawn in sand, pushed backwards with the winds of science over time.  The movement towards more big data, more sophisticated and predictive machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence will continue to push back that line. No perfect rationality may be possible, but the unbounded parcels shrink ever more.

The changes to the public sector brought about by the artificial intelligence revolution will be vast and complex. That complexity, Simon’s work urges us to understand, even beauty found in overwhelming complexity, is not the same as inexplicable: “Wonderful,” he writes in the opening of one of his final works, “but not incomprehensible” (Simon, 2019, p. 1). Simon may seem an unrepentant positivist for some in public administration who embrace more qualitative methods, or at least a post-normal  methodologic pluralism (Riccucci, 2010). But that represents an unfair, limited view of Simon’s work, who after all published for forty-nine years after his 1952 debate with Dwight Waldo in the pages of American Political Science Review (Simon et al., 1952).  A more expansive and forgiving view of Simon can be found in Rorty’s view (Rorty, 1982, p. xvi): “It is important to realize that the empirical philosophers – the positivists – were still doing Philosophy.” 

 “There is no theorist more clever than the scholar claiming to have no theory” write the authors of a primer on theories of public administration (Frederickson, Smith, Larimer, & Licari, 2018, p. 3). Though they were gently chiding James Wilson’s  proclamation (Wilson, 1989, pp. xi–xii) that any grand organizational theories would be merely “partial, place- and time-bound insights,” I heed their advice. At this time, I am a scholar in the post-normal mode (Riccucci, 2010). Though I am a methodological pragmatist who is open to many ways of answering research questions, I instinctively reach for positivist, testable, falsifiable, and empirical answers in my scholarship. I am a public administration scholar because the field is multi-disciplinary and multi-methodological. Attempts to constrain the research questions and methods germane to the field are pointless because public administration practices are as old as civilization itself, even if the field of study that constitutes public administration is still young (Frederickson et al., 2018).
 
To borrow an excellent turn-of-phrase , I work in the prose of Herbert Simon, but read and dream in the poetry of Waldo. Herbert Simon, because I value the clarity that constrained and falsifiable hypotheses bring to value-laden policy discussions, and the satisfaction of working within sophisticated statistical frameworks. Dwight Waldo – because the most interesting questions I explore are value-laden: the impact of public surveillance on wellbeing and street-level discretion (Adams & Mastracci, 2017, 2019b, 2019a); the effect of street-level prosecutors on general criminal deterrence (Mourtgos & Adams, 2019a); the alienation wrought by detaching emotional expression and public service (Mastracci & Adams, 2018); the importance of listening to the voices of public servants rather than imposing our own scholarly suppositions (Mourtgos & Adams, 2019b); and the difficulty of squaring public opinion and legal opinion regarding police use-of-force as the two rapidly diverge (Mourtgos & Adams, forthcoming). I cannot bring to bear the post-positivist methodological weapons of Simon without first looking for targets through Waldo’s eyes.

In her address to the Southern Political Association, Mary Guy (2003, p. 651) states: “The field is served best when we remain self-consciously aware of the implications of our models and the information they produce.” This highlighting of the importance of the subjective experience of the human mind is a timely reminder for the role of future public administration scholars, tasked with approaching a world of governance rapidly changed through greater and greater reliance on big data, machine learning, expert systems, and artificial intelligence. Herbert Simon saw intuition as a hidden thinking process; but in a hypothetical world where a machine intelligence achieved true, human or greater level intelligence, our ability to understand the subjective experience of that intelligence is not guaranteed. The human subjective experience represents the cash value of human ethics, of human inquiry, of human philosophy. John Adams is still correct: Two decades hence, the best of public administration scholars will be those who remain aware of the human and ethical implications of models and information produced by inhuman (or at least not human) “minds.”  The field of public administration should be prepared to begin this undertaking today – for that is what we will be for tomorrow.

## Five Public Administration Theories

> This essay is written from perspective of teaching a class on PA – what theories are important, what gets cut for time? 

Public administration is distinct from mere public policy; as Woodrow Wilson(1887) wrote: “Administration is...government in action.” The supplemental papers chosen for the upcoming Bolivian middle-management seminar were selected to provide context to the David Rosenbloom text which will be used as the underlying framework of the class. A potential danger of the using the Rosenbloom text alone is it relies on an assumption of a United States Constitution separation of powers. While most of the underlying lessons drawn from the Rosenbloom text are applicable in a foreign government context, I have chosen five theory readings which are focused on “government in action.” These readings are theoretically applicable in an international administration, with lessons for the students to draw on as they return to their respective positions. I have chosen the readings for their inter-applicability, their cohesion to one another, as well, which in the end provides the students with a robust theoretical foundation. I supplement the chosen readings with a shorter discussion of two additional readings, which while perhaps valuable in a different context, do not lend themselves well to the Bolivian seminar series.

### Michael Lipsky: “Street Level Bureaucracy”

Michael Lipsky’s importance to the study of public administration lies in his identification of what he calls “street level bureaucrats.” Lipsky defines these critical employees as: “Public service workers who interact directly with citizens in the course of their jobs, and who have substantial discretion in the execution of their work…”

Lipsky’s theory is critical to the idea of government in action, especially as it relates to mid-level managers. As these managers move towards greater responsibility in their respective agencies, there is also a danger  their collective attention will necessarily turn towards broad policy and idea formation. However, as Lipsky makes clear, by re-focusing on street-level bureaucrats, our students will be better managers through service to the poorest citizens, and also through better budgetary management.

First, as Lipsky writes: “The poorer people are, the greater the influence street-level bureaucrats tend to have over them.” Our students should recognize this important reality, especially as it relates to Rosenbloom’s discussion of the managerial focus in executive branch agencies. The managerial focus on efficiency has historically resulted in social inequity among minority groups. While our students are no doubt required to seek efficiency in their operations, they must also be able to pursue social equity where appropriate. To do otherwise disproportionately affects the poor negatively. The poor are forced to seek those benefits from the government which they are unable to afford in the private sector, and as the “provider of last resort,” the government will be judged by its ability to serve that population.

On the subject of efficiency and fiscal responsibility, our students should learn from Lispky that the salaries of street-level bureaucrats will represent a huge portion of local government budgets. As as example, Lispky points out that “in large cities over 90% of police expenditures is used to pay for salaries.” This huge allocation is an indication of the importance of street-level bureaucrats have both within an organization, and a community. It also provides an opportunity for our student administrators to begin thinking about their responsibility to be effective and efficient with public monies. Rosenbloom puts efficiency, effectiveness, and economy as the guiding principles of the managerial approach to public administration, and with such a large part of the budget devoted to street-level bureaucrats, those salaries must take a commensurately large portion of administrators’ focus.

### H. George Fredrickson: “Toward a New Public Administration”

In a confident and influential essay explaining the "New Public Administration," H. George Fredrickson adds social equity to the traditional public administration goals of efficiency, economy, and coordinated management. Social equity is defined as “activities designed to enhance the political power and economic well-being of disadvantaged minorities.” Frederickson does not just add social equity to the traditional goals, but raises it as a "first among peers” among the traditional goals. Our students will gain a more sophisticated view of public administration through the lens of Frederickson, especially in the context of Rosenbloom’s framing of managerial goals as discussed above in the Lipsky discussion.  

In line with our stated goal of expanding our students’ reading past a purely American context, social equity is a goal consistent with foreign governments. In fact, Frederickson sees social inequity as a “fundamental, if long-range, threat to the viability of this or any political system.” We may assume our Bolivian students accept governmental stability as a laudable goal; adding social equity as a goal of public administration helps them achieve it. 

Frederickson argues “New Public Administration” provides a “real normative base.” What he means here is that by promoting social equity as a goal, we are providing our students an actionable theory, wherein they can pursue measureable “good.” In line with Lipsky, Frederickson recognizes the importance of reaching into the “professional schools where most public servants are trained” and his new public administration aims to improve the management skillsets of those students.

### J. Steven Ott: “Understanding Organizational Culture”

Whereas Lipsky and Frederickson provide our students with a focus on providing social equity through governmental action at the street level, we must also not lose sight of the fact that our students are the future senior management of their respective organizations. To that end, J. Steven Ott’s critical essay on organizational culture is important. Besides being a pre-eminent emissary of the University of Utah’s public management program, Ott gives our students a sound framework for understanding change within their organization, especially as related to what Ott describes as the “unseen and unobservable force that is always behind organizational activities that can be seen and observed.” 
Whether it originates internally or externally, our students can likely be expected to face serious organizational changes during their career. Through Ott we will train our students to be critical observers of their organization's “shared values, beliefs, assumptions, perceptions, norms, artifacts, and patterns of behavior.” By training our students while they are at the mid-management level, we give them the opportunity to begin their observational analysis at an earlier phase of their career. It seems logical that by increasing the length of time they are engaged in such critical analysis, they better prepare themselves for leadership at their organization's most senior levels. That preparation will prove useful as our future leaders encounter change within their organization. Ott’s essay is the most abstract of theories included in our students assigned readings, but no less valuable for it gives our students a strong foundation for navigating organizational change. Ott is fully aware of this need, as he writes  the “organizational culture perspective is especially useful for describing, explaining, and...predicting behavior when organizations are facing fundamental changes, particularly changes involving their identities.” 

### Donald F. Kettl: “Administrative Traditions”

At first glance, Kettl’s historical analysis of American public administration would seem to run counter to this paper’s stated goal of providing more international context to the Rosenbloom reading. However, by analyzing the historical “roots” of American administration through Kettl’s essay, our Bolivian students are better able to understand the “branches” of Rosenbloom’s constitutional analysis.

The peculiar American tradition of public administration is full of conflicts, e.g. what government should do versus how government should do its business. Kettl provides a framework for understanding these conflicts by describing and comparing four formative theories: the Hamiltonian, Jeffersonian, Madisonian, and Wilsonian traditions of governance.

 Hamilton argued for a strong executive power, especially in respect to federal banking power, while Jefferson was a rural farmer with strong beliefs in the power of common people and a distrust of national government. Kettle points out that while Jefferson had philosophical notions of a weak executive, once he was president he exercised that power “ruthlessly,” based on Hamiltonian views of the executive. 
 
Madison had a subtler approach that "hinged on balancing power among the major players..." This strategy will be familiar to our Bolivian students, as it reflects what Rosenbloom describes as a political approach to administration: a "blending" of powers rather than a strict separation. However, like Jefferson, once Madison became president, he exercised power in line with the strong Hamiltonian tradition. 

Wilson and the Progressives end up seeing the Hamilton prediction of a grand commerce state, and realized the need for a stronger government to effectively manage it. Wilson wanted politics out of administration and managed to explain for Progressives how to strengthen government without threatening democracy. As one of my stated goals for these supplemental readings was to focus on “government in action,” the Wilsonian tradition offers valuable wisdom, for a Rohr famously said, "It is getting harder to run a constitution than to frame one."

Kettl sees a big problem with the big players in government subscribing to the "vending machine model" of public policy: they assume that by piling money into the top of the machine, services will magically pop out of the bottom. They don't pay enough attention to the questions of how to accomplish the goals of government, only the goals themselves. Our students should be reminded of our earlier discussion of Lipsky, as the vending machine only runs through the actions of street-level bureaucrats.

### Barzelay and Armajani: “Breaking Through Bureaucracy”

While Rosenbloom makes the case that public management is different than private business management, we turn to Michael Barzelay and Babak J. Armajani’s essay “Breaking Through Bureaucracy” to provide a realistic argument for taking lessons from some of the successes of the private sector in the late 20th century America and applying those lessons in a framework of public governance. This “post-Bureaucratic paradigm” focuses on quality and value, accountability and relationships, product and customers.

As the authors point out, the bureaucratic structure grew in response to the American shift from an agrarian society to an urbanized one. Our Bolivian counterparts, as custodians of a government making a similar transition, should be aware of the potential pitfalls of a purely bureaucratic focus. 

Barzelay and Armajani bring a modern understanding of concepts covered in earlier readings, by redefining what efficiency and economy mean in a modern administrative context. For example, they will give our students a framework for understanding relationships by structuring that abstract concept through customer relationships, production relationships, oversight relationships, and membership relationships. “Total quality management,” a concept firmly rooted in private industry production for nearly a half-century, will already be familiar to our students, but now introduced into how they are examining public administration.

This paper also fits seamlessly with our four previously discussed supplemental readings. Lipsky and Frederickson both push our students towards what Barzelay and Armajani call “results citizens value”; that is, to remain grounded in the front-line services of their agencies, by managing relationships between street-level bureaucrats and “customers,” and manage the delivery of social equity to those in society with most need of it. Ott’s theory on organizational culture fits well into a post-bureaucratic paradigm, as Barzelay and Armajani devote considerable thought to making public managers “historically aware,” able to diagnose unsatisfactory organizational structure and help other employees embrace a change to the post-bureaucratic paradigm. These “historically aware public managers” will be better prepared through Kettl’s explanation of the American historical context, especially how conflicts in administrative theory were rooted in the early founding visions of administrative thinkers.

### Excluded Theories: Frederick C. Mosher

I am specifically recommending two readings be left out of the Bolivian curriculum, both by Frederick C. Mosher: “Watergate: Implications for Responsible Government” and “Democracy and the Public Service: The Collective Services.” 

Both papers suffer from the same shortcoming, an over-focus on American public administration, with lessons too narrowly drawn for export to foreign administrators. Mosher’s Watergate essay was in response to a uniquely American controversy, and its recommendation that employees be required to sign ethical codes of conduct is a relatively lackluster response to a cataclysmic event. Mosher argues Watergate was an “aberration, and extension, and culmination of events,” which is useful for American students to understand. However, while our Bolivian students may be familiar with the Watergate scandal at a surface level, with the seminar lasting only five days, there does not appear to be as much to be gained from a deeper understanding of that singular event.

In his second essay, Mosher provides a history of the labor movement in government organizations, and asks “what is negotiable?” and “who bargains for whom?” in respect to public sector unions. The essay is frankly brilliant in recounting the challenges to public sector unions, and the reasons for their growth at all levels of government. Yet, here again Mosher’s writing is almost exclusively of use to students of American governance, not public administration in an international context. While public sector unions may in fact be an important issue in other countries, Mosher focuses on the uniquely American aspects: presidential orders, labor boards, etc. 
In both essays, Mosher wades into the “deep weeds” of his topics, providing his American students with great material, but in the international context those deep weeds may be too tall to see over.

### Conclusion

As shown, the five readings selected and described in this paper work together to provide context to Rosenbloom’s “Public Administrative Theory and the Separation of Powers.” Lispky gives a focus on the street-level bureaucrats who make government “work.” Frederickson adds social equity to the goals of a public agency. Ott provides a theoretical framework for our students to examine the workings of their own agency. Kettl gives Rosenbloom historical context through an examination of the governance traditions which have predominated in American thinking. Finally, Barzelay and Armajani begin to usher our students away from a traditional bureaucratic focus on efficiency and towards a sophisticated, modern understanding of relationships, quality management, and value. All five readings are applicable in a variety of contexts, which is important to our international students. This paper recommends Mosher’s works be reserved for other classes with only students of American public administration, as both papers would prove less useful to our Bolivian students.
