<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 8</span> Building a Question List</h1>
<p>In this chapter, I present some of the themes you might encounter across subfields of American Politics and Public Administration, along with potential citation sources to investigate as you prepare. The questions are grouped into potential required questions, and those that I see more often as “optional,” or shorter essays.</p>
<div id="required-questions" class="section level2" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Required Questions</h2>
<p>These are the types of questions that generally require the student to demonstrate a broad grasp of the entire subfield, and the main arguments within that field. To some degree, exam graders are often looking for the student to not just cover the biggest controversies and unanswered questions in the field, but to also declare where they stand. For this, I will usually start my outline with a declarative statement, i.e. “I say presidents are fundamentally weak.” This is definitely a preference and even personality-driven option, however, so use what works best for your ‘voice.’</p>
<div id="presidential-power-constitutional-theory-executive-branch-constraints" class="section level3" number="8.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> Presidential Power, Constitutional Theory, Executive Branch Constraints</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Much has been made over the years of the American Constitution’s structure as a mechanism to guard against tyranny. The Constitutions’ resilience has been touted as an example of excellent institutional design that has made manifest Madison’s theory of separating powers and using each to check the other. Imagine that the American people elect a president with little respect for this system and for the specific theory of a restrained presidency. Leaving aside theory, what is the empirical evidence for the ability of the system to resist a president lacking self-restraint? To what extent does the larger Executive Branch restrain the president’s actions? Assess the ability to Congress, the courts, political parties, federalism and other institutions to restrain the Chief Executive. Does Madison’s theory hold up to what we know about modern American government?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>American politics plays out among two sets of actors: political elites and the public. Thinking about American politics and policymaking as a whole, discuss the relative influence of political elites and the American public. Does the public drive our national politics and policymaking? Or do political elites have most of the power in our political system? Critically evaluate American politics scholarship relevant to these questions. Be sure to identify which authors and the specific literature are most important to our understanding of this dynamic.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.3</span> Is political science relevant?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>An irony of modern political discussion is that political scientists rarely appear as experts on American politics in the media, where they are far outnumbered by journalists, professional pundits, and political operatives. Make the case that political science has generated specific insights into American politics that simply cannot be gleaned from close journalistic coverage of current events. What distinguishes political science from popular discourse about American politics and what findings should political scientists emphasize to correct popular misunderstandings about American politics? Using several examples from contemporary politics (possibly including, but not limited to, the current election, Congressional gridlock, recent court cases, trends in policymaking), how does political science provide a distinctive understanding of American politics?</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.4</span> Elitists versus Pluralists</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The study of American politics has often been marked by disputes over theory or method. For example, the debate over elitist and pluralist explanations of political power in America or the debate over the value of rational choice as a general theoretical approach to the study of American politics. In your response, first, identify an important debate over theory and/or method in at least two different substantive areas of study in American politics (e.g., Congress, the bureaucracy, voting, the courts, or economic policy) and explain what the scholarly debate was about. Second, discuss whether these debates have served to advance or hinder our understanding of politics in these areas of study.</p>

<p>It can be argued that American politics plays out among two different classes of actors: political elites and the general public. Thinking about American politics and policymaking as a whole, discuss the relative influence of political elites and the broader American public. Does the public drive our national politics and policymaking? Or do political elites have most of the power in our political system and control both the agenda and much of the decision-making? What larger theories, and which scholars, help us understand the tensions between mass democracy and elite politics, and the paradox of a normative commitment to political equality coexisting with unequal influence of elite, organized, and well-funded groups in modern American politics?</p>

Explain how the development of large and complex federal bureaucracy in the post-World War II (and perhaps especially post Great Society) era has led to new understandings of Congress and the Presidency.

Second, in your judgment, is the presidency a very powerful office, or is the office inherently weak, and why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>President Obama has received both praise from his allies and criticism from his opponents for his use of unilateral action in policymaking. What does the political science literature tell us about presidential power and unilateral action? Are Obama’s actions part of the tradition of presidential politics or a significant shift? What does Obama’s use of unilateral action in the White House tell us about the power of the modern presidency?</p>

<p>In Federalist 10, James Madison famously argued that pluralism could save America from factionalism. Yet, today it seems as if the policy process is both typified by pluralism and sometimes dominated by factionalism. Drawing on the scholarship on both interest groups and the policy process, what conclusions can be drawn regarding how pluralism influences the policy process? Make sure to review both the history of thinking about interest groups and how several different models of the policy process understand the role of interest groups.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.23</span> Racial and ethnic progress in American public policy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Throughout U.S. history the dominant group (i.e. WASPs during the majority of U.S. history) has tried to adopt public policies to institutionalize racial or ethnic inequality to gain political advantages over minority groups. Examples of such institutional domination include slavery imposed on African Americans, the forced relocation of American Indians, the exclusionary immigration laws such as the 1882 Chines Exclusion Act, and the 1924 National Origin Act against Southern and Eastern Europeans and Jews. But the dominant WASPs also sometimes passed legislations in an attempt to protect the rights of the minority groups. Examples of such equality-oriented legislation includes the 13th – 15th Constitutional Amendments, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Acts of 1965, which were all passed by majority-white Congresses. Discuss how and why these policy changes took place in the U.S. history. Is there a trend toward racial and ethnic progress in terms of American public policies over time? Identify the most important political science literature in this area.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From Aristotle of classic Greece to John Rawls of modern America, countless first-rate scholars have put their keen eyes on how humans behave in the political arenas. Still there are too many questions unanswered. Based on your understanding of the American politics, do humans act rationally when it comes to the issues of voting for a party? If so, why do they sometimes make decisions that seem utterly irrational in politics? Are they attracted to certain candidates’ special qualities that are difficult to quantify in rational terms? Are voters for the most part calculating for their own economic gains when they decide politically?</p>
