# Structure of the Book

I have arranged two large chapters, one for each of the major subfields covered in the book. First, in the [Public Adminstration Pre-Write chapter](#pa-pre), we provide many of the possible questions you might encounter in Public Administration exams. In [the next chapter](#ap-pre), we do the same for American Politics. In both these early chapters, we are providing you with examples of full comprehensive pre-writes. In the next two chapters, we provide the actual comprehensive exam answers for full exams, [one for Public Administration](#pa-real) and one for [American politics](#ap-real). The [closing chapter](#summary) wraps up with some general information and strategy going into your own exams.

## A Gentle Warning

Because this book is easily available on the internet, I strongly suggest you do not plagiarize from it. Synthesize it, gently massage it, and use whatever you can make useful to your own views on the relevant academic fields. Don't tempt the TurnItIn monster - it won't end well!

Further, remember that every Ph.D. program has its own flavor. My program at the University of Utah, for example, is relatively less quantitatively focused than some other programs, and places a tremendous amount of focus on developing thoughtful scholarship on equity in public policy and administration. Your program **will be** different, and you should consider those differences as you read through the supplied answers.
