# Introduction {#intro}

Every Ph.D. student lives the first few years dreading comprehensive exams, and the rest of their academic careers trying to convince more junior scholars that everything will be okay. These exams have the very-real capability of derailing your career plans, and should not be overlooked. One of the most common requests I get from more junior scholars is for examples of comprehensive exams. This should not be surprising. As members of the academy, we are trained to build carefully upon the shoulders of giants - i.e., beg, borrow, and steal, but add a little action to the pot while you're at it. 

It's been said that if you have to teach something twice, write it down. In that spirit, and having freely given these examples away in the past, I put together this book to help Ph.D. students make the difficult transition to Ph.D. candidates. I hope you find it useful.

## Acknowledgments

My own path through comprehensive exams, like every one of my academic efforts, was only made possible because of the mentorship and love of those around me. My dissertation chair, Dr. Sharon Mastracci, is ultimately responsible for giving me a shot at an academic world I didn't even realize existed. Dr. James Curry always left his office door open for me to drop in and learn more about the profession. Dr. Steve Nelson insisted I'd be a happier Ph.D. student than a law school student - he was right as usual. Scott Mourtgos has proven to be the most exciting and productive partner in ~~crime~~ criminal justice that I could have hoped for.

## Dedication

Time slips, men fall. Academia is but a sliver of life, and for the rest I rely on the love and support of my partner Annette. Therefore this book is dedicated to you Annette. I'd die for you, writing a dedication is too easy.
